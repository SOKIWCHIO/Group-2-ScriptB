- Is this real?  

One of the strangest recruiting adds Iâ€™ve seen yet.  Itâ€™s more about the landscape than the education, pay or otherwise.  

Iâ€™m on the fence about taking it down.
- The vacancy is real since it is posted on Lund University's [website](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/vacancies). The job posting itself has more relevant information than the post. Although this post seems like a copy-paste of what one would see on Twitter or even Linkedin - so could be a case of unfamiliarity with the platform. In Sweden, PhD positions must be publicly advertised, so this post is part of that effort too I suppose.
- Things are kinda desperate in academia, I guess. ðŸ˜‚

It's an entertaining pitch, at least.
- I didn't realize my humble ad would raise a discussion as to whether it's real.  It's as real as it gets.
- Yup.  Doesnâ€™t bode well for the lab, though.
- You replied a year later???? Â Wtf
