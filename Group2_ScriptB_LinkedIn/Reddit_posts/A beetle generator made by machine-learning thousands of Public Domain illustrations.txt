- Pokemon devs want to know your location
- Ah yes, number 28, the shape shifting beetle





Funny how's the numbers are just 28
- Spectacular work. Thanks for sharing. Repo?
- Can I use it to generate one (made-up)beetle if I for some reason need it?
- Is there a link or something so we can play with the beetle generator ourselves?
- Cool! But they obviously only used beetles from the leaf beetle family (Chrysomelidae). If they used beetles from all of the families, this animation would include some waaay more crazy forms.
- This looks like a really interesting way to visualize their comparative anatomy. Something like this would be a great educational tool.

- Just when I thought my acid trip couldnâ€™t get any cooler! Thanks Reddit!
- Interesting that they all have dotted, vertical lines.
- And they're all perfect lil friends
- Beetles eat my carpet at my feet.
- Is this available for public use?
- Given how many fucking beetle species where is all of these probably exist irl
- u/thesonofhadesssss
- My mind immediately goes to randomly generated video game enemies
- Fat guy! Small guy! Stripey guy! Yellow guy! Repeat!
- Cell transforming into perfect form remastered
- That reminds me so much of the design studio scene in Bladerunner 2049, where they make memories.
