Title: Advice Needed for Machine learning/Generative AI Internships 

Content:
Hi everyone,

I’m looking for guidance on how to secure and excel in Machine Learning (ML) or Generative AI internships. Specifically:

1. What should I include in my resume to get shortlisted?

2. What skills and concepts should I focus on to ace interviews?

3. How can I prepare to perform well during the internship itself?

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

Working on Data Structures and Algorithms (beginner, practicing on LeetCode).

Covered core ML concepts: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, and deep learning.

Studied Generative AI topics like autoencoders, transformers, and GANs.


I’d really appreciate advice on areas I should improve or additional skills/resources I should explore to make myself more competitive.

Thank you so much for your help!

- I mean it sounds like you have a very good start. 

Include real examples of projects so they know you’re not just listing buzzwords that you don’t actually have experience with. It’s one thing to say you know about self-supervised learning, it’s another level to have actually setup a training process that uses it, for example.
