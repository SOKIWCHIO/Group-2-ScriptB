Title: Advice for beginner in computer vision

Content:
Hey everyone, 

I am a 3rd computer science student. I have completed learning basic ML concepts from the Machine learning specialization course on coursera  Andrew ng after which I practiced whatever I learned on couple of datasets on kaggle. Along with this I want to get into the field of computer vision. I would really appreciate it if someone could point me towards the right resources to learn stuff and also a proper roadmap to begin with.

Thank you in advance.
