Title: Advice on preparation for application for Bioimaging & Biophysics program

Content:
Hello dear redditors,

I'm planning to apply to integrated life science program in University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Bioimaging and biophysics module). My undergrad major was Biochemistry and molecular biology with specialization in bioinformatics.

Is there any advice you can give me regarding what thing I should learn to up my chances of admission? Right now I'm learning basics of analysis with ImageJ and taking the machine learning course by Andrew NG in coursera.
