Title: Any advice for a wet labber in biotech wanting to gain these skills.

Content:
Hi Bioinformaticians

I'm in the UK and I work at a UK based immunotherapy company. I really want to up skill in computation biology and bioinformatics.  I know you must get these sort of questions quite often.

Some of the things I'd like to learn

1)  design/optimise antibodies based on the structure of my antigen.

2) predict peptides presented by  HLA1/2

3) protein-protein interaction

4) Structure prediction from aa seqeunce (i know I-TASSER can be used for this.)  
   
So generally protein work, but maybe RNAseq too.   
I was thinking of learning Python as I've heard its the easiest code for biologists to learn. Or would getting a grips of the specific programs help more? I'm currently working my way through an MIT computation biology course on Youtube- to pick up bits of information.   
Any recommendations/resources/tutorials/courses are welcome. Ideally free ones, but I'm open to paying if I need to.

Thanks

- I teach basic bioinformatics skills starting with Python. I've written a bunch of exercises and tests to help you learn how the language itself works -- things like strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries, then reading/writing files, dealing w/stdin, stdout, stderr, and ideas like regular expressions as well as how to run and write tests for your programs and functions. You can find all the programs and tests at [https://github.com/kyclark/tiny\_python\_projects](https://github.com/kyclark/tiny_python_projects). The main programs are generic, having nothing to do with bioinformatics, but in the "extras" directory you can find how I extend these ideas to biology. HTH!
- Not sure with protein work but with rnaseq I would recommend to learn bash/Unix and R. As a bioinformatician who uses programs and software others make it is what I primarily use.
I think if your not going to be making your own software their is no great need to learn python.
- PyMol is the standard protein visualization tool and it has a Python API. I mostly work with sequencing data as well, but my colleagues who do protein structure work all use Python.
