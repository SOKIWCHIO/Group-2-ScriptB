Title: Any advice? Applying for a Biology PhD with low uGPA but MS with great GPA and Industry Experience

Content:
Any advice with the following stats, I applied right out of undergrad before my first semester grades from my MS were in and didn't get any interviews so I am stressing in advance about applying for fall 2023 start.

**Undergrad Institution:** Ivy League

**Major(s):**  B.S. in Animal Science, graduated on the accelerated track in 3 years instead of 4

**Overall GPA:** 3.13/4.0 \*GPA is on a 4.3 scale so that is it scaled onto 4.0 scale (urgh I know, a few C+'s and one C, most were freshman year)

**Grad Institution:** Top 20 University 

**Major(s):**  M.Sc. in Tumor Biology (lots of specialized classes)

**Overall GPA:** 3.97/4.0

**Type of Student:** White female, domestic

**GRE Scores:** V: 159 (82%) Q: 165 (84%) W: 4.5 (80%) (Plan to retake even though some of my schools don't accept GRE)

**Research Experience:**

\- Undergrad \~8 months of research in animal physiology at Ivy League vet school, under 2 PI's

\- Graduate School: One year as the only student in the lab, director PI and Jr Faculty mentorship, hands on mouse work/breeding, journal club presentations, mid-author pub on this research project

\- 3 months (summer after graduation) optimizing COVID PCR testing at Public Health Lab

\- 1 year working as a Study Director at CRO, working with patient derived xenografts and flow cytometry, very intensive position managing 25 client projects, writing protocols and analyzing/presenting data

\- Working from now until PhD as a Drug Discovery Project Manager at a AI/Machine learning startup, selection of assays, medicinal chemistry, data analysis, fluid planning of next experiments for novel targets, tons of very connected PhD colleagues (esp on West Coast) 

Positions held: Medical Technologist, Study Director, Project Manager - Drug Discovery (current) 

**Publications/Posters:**

\- 1 publications (mid-author) IF: 22

\- No posters or conferences but most of my experience has been during COVID times

**Awards/Honors/Recognitions:** Dean's List final undergrad semester

**LoRs:** 1 from PI during MSc which is my publication, 1 from Founder of my current company (CEO, same Ugrad as me, many employees at company have PhDs from schools on my list, small group <90 total employees at company), Final letter I have options for: Can use one of my team members who did their PhD at the specific school I am applying to, could use PI from undergrad (although he doesn't know a ton about my research since I left undergrad), may also be adding PT work for a clincial CRO with a CEO who has MD PhD and was director of two different medical schools? Advice on who to choose as final recommender?

**Applying to Where:** I have listed all below, bolded are the ones I am definitely applying to, I understand some are a stretch but I am willing to pay the $ and put it the time for the slim chance. I am applying to whatever group oversees the cancer research, I plan to reach out to PI's in the next few months. Any great schools I am forgetting about? Especially on East coast, midwest or near colorado?

**Harvard**

**MIT**

U of Mich

**George Washington**

**Georgetown**

**John Hopkins**

**Yale**

**Cold Spring Harbor**

**UW Madison**

**Northwestern**

**MD Anderson**

UPenn

Duke

**Berkley**

**UCSF**

UChicago

Princeton

Mayo Clinic

University of Cincinnati

Purdue

U Colorado (Med Campus Aurora CO)

U of W (st louis)

Brandeis 

Colorado State

University of Pittsburg

Not confident about my ugrad GPA but hoping my MS and industry experience makes up for it? Any others who have gone from industry? I make great money at my current job but I know in our current scientific environment especially in drug development that you cannot ever be the boss or the brains if you don't have a PhD, I know this isn't everyone's opinion but it is the decision I have made.

Comments:
- I don't think they give a shit about undergrad. Your recent performance is more important.
- Did you graduate? Can you do the work? Prove it in the interview. I've never disclosed grades or been asked about them outside of school, just successes that show I am up to the task.
- You sound like a very good candidate.

On east coast, I would maybe look at the University of Rochester and Cornell as well. Farther south Florida (UF) and Georgia (Emory) are decent. Midwest, it could be worth looking at University of Texas stuff.

I say look at not necessarily add because you've got some stuff all over the place, some of which is stronger or weaker in drug development. That's fine but you are also going to live there for 5ish years, strongly inadvisable to go somewhere you don't like. PhD stressful enough when you can have your style of relaxation/stress relief.

Per grades I wouldn't worry that much about getting in to a PhD but it can make getting fellowships more of a pain...
- Do you have labs and a research focus in mind? I went straight from a masters to a phd at UW Madison, but I talked directly to PIs in direct-admit departments. The places I was accepted at gave me offers basically after initial phone/skype interviews. For my situation, it helped a lot of be familiar with the area the PIs studied and have vague ideas of what I'd contribute to the lab.

If you are primarily looking at rotation-based departments, I'd still look into several labs you'd want to work with and reach out to the PIs before applying. A phd is a commitment and taxing on your mental health at times, so being in a place you're happy at and working on something that excites you outweighs the school's prestige. My colleagues around the world could not care any less that I was from UW because I had passion for my field and the research I published.

As for my experience pre-phd: I think I finished undergrad floating around a 3.0 (maybe a 3.25 within my science classes), and masters was probably a 4.0, but no one has looked at those grades outside of having a transmit submitted as part of an application.
