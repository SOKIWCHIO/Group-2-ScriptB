Title: Any good upcoming conferences to submit a paper to?

Content:
I have a preprint related to bioinformatics/biomolecular design that I’ll be releasing soon. I believe it’s a strong paper and has the potential to be accepted at a good venue. Unfortunately, I’ve missed the deadlines for major conferences like ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS.

Are there any upcoming conferences focused on machine learning, ML for science, or computational biology that I could submit to? I’d probably prefer a biology-related workshop rather than a main conference track. Later on I would like to publish an extended version in a good journal.

P.S. NeurIPS hasn’t released the list of upcoming workshops yet, I’m hoping there will be something suitable there, but I’m still exploring other options in the meantime.

Comments:
- Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) 2026 looks like a pretty decent conference with a submission deadline of August 1st - good luck!
- I think it's too late this year, but ISCB, RECOMB, and MLCB are some great conferences. You might also look at the [CSHL meetings](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings) for something that would be relevant.
