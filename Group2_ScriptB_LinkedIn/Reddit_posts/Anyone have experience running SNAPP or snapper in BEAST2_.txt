Title: Anyone have experience running SNAPP or snapper in BEAST2?

Content:
Hey all,

I'm trying to respond to reviews that I recieved for a manuscript generated from my master's thesis. I have cox1 and 2bRAD data for 8 species in a genus of flies, and one of the reviews suggested I run a SNAPP/snapper analysis to compare with the phylogeny I generated. For the life of me, I cannot get it to run, or even open my files. The only machines I have available to me are two macbooks, one with an old intel chip and one with a new M2 Max chip; I have BEAST2 installed on both and am able to open both BEAST and BEAUTi. From my 2bRAD data, I've used ipyrad to generate a phylip file that just pulls one snp per locus, which I've then converted to a nexus file. On both machines, BEAUTi just fatally freezes when I try to load my alignment. I'm really out of my depth here, does anyone have any advice? I will add that my computational skills are okay but not great, so I'm learning as I go here. And if anyone has any suggestions for user-friendly species delimitation software, I'd appreciate that too!

- maybe you just need wait it, I spent 15 minutes last and it work.
- I remember having this issue when trying to run BEAST+SNAPPER on an old Mac desktop. It ran fine on my new laptop with an M3 chip, though. Iâ€™m thinking if you can find a computer that has better resources then you might be fine.
- Glad to hear it worked! Did it take a really long time to load the alignment file? And was BEAUTi somewhat frozen while it loaded? My SNP matrix is fairly large, which might explain why it's taking so long.

This is the tutorial I used to do my analyses. It was made by one of the creators of SNAPPER. You need to know how to use Linux for this, but it includes a Ruby script that creates XML files for you super fast. I never ended up using BEAUTi because I had ~1 million SNPs and it just would freeze instead of opening.
- That's EXACTLY what's happening with mine!! I'm going to try this, thank you so much!
