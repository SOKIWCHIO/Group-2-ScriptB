Title: Are there free alternatives to CMView/PyMol to 3D-visualize CASP .rr files?

Content:
Hi experts,

I'm tinkering around with the original AlphaFold machine learning architecture, because AlphaFold 2 had me curious (unfortunately, AlphaFold 2 is too far out for me as a layman in both biology and machine learning). 

All is well, except for the fact that I'm unable to generate these nice-looking 3D plots of the proteins. Google tells me that CMView is the tool to go and that I'd need PyMol for the 3D-part of it. Unfortunately, I can't get them to work on my machine. The CMView version that's available for the unwashed masses is too old to work with PyMol and everything just crashes upon opening a .rr file.

Hence my question: Is there something else out there to produce these nice, juicy 3D models which I can show off to my colleagues? They weren't impressed with my distograms, they wanted 3D. 3D they shall have.

(Or may I'm overly stupid and there are up-to-date free CMView and PyMol versions out there - that'd work just as fine.)

Thanks!
