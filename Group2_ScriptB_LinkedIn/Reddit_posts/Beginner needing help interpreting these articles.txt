Title: Beginner needing help interpreting these articles

Content:
TD/LR: I need help understanding what these projects are doing/mean? 

&#x200B;

My assignment was to see if I can incorporate any of the methods used in [this article](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-abstract/22/5/bbab054/6184410?redirectedFrom=fulltext), into [this project](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00457?cookieSet=1). 

The first article: resulted that using a Gradient boosting decision tree algorithm in conjunction with the MIN + GB simulation protocol achieved the best performance. 

What does a MIN + GB simulation protocol mean? 

Second article: Uses a gradient boosting machine learning model with this explicit feature attribution can predict binding affinity with high accuracy. 

What does explicit feature attribution mean? 

Thank you if you can help me, anything information would be great.
