Title: Books for a Computer Scientist

Content:
Hi everyone,

I am a postdoc researcher in AI, so I have a strong background in computer science, machine learning, and deep learning. I am fascinated by science in general, and I would try to use my knowledge in Next Generation Sequencing. Since I do not have a strong background (actually, I don't have a background at all xD) in genomics and bioinformatics, would you like to suggest me some books that provide me enough biology/genomics background to start working in NGS?

Thank you very much!

Comments:
- How is your biology knowledge in general? I'd start with "Molecular biology of the cell" by Bruce Alberts at al. Then get something more detailed on topics that interest you.
- A Computer Scientistâ€™s Guide to Cell Biology

Quickstart Molecular Biology 

Molecular Biology of the Cell
- [learngenomics.dev](https://learngenomics.dev) would be a good start but not deep enough to cover everything.
- That is a good read

- Id recommend Introduction to Genomics by Arthur Lesk
- https://books.google.com/books/about/Molecular\_Biology\_of\_the\_Gene.html?id=aRUtAAAAQBAJ&source=kp\_book\_description
- Actually I have some memories from high school, so no that much. Thank you for your suggestion!
- Thanks a lot!
- Thanks a lot!
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you!
- I would also recommend Essential Cell Biology, also by Alberts et al., which is effectively a slightly more accessible version of Mol Bio of the Cell. I'm also from a CS background and have found it extremely helpful.
- Thank you very much for your suggestion!
