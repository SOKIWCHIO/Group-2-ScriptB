Title: Books on ADCs

Content:
Hi Biology!

I'm hoping to learn more about antibody drug conjugates, I was wondering if anyone had any book recommendations?

I've had a Google around, but all I've been able to find are multi-hundred pound textbooks. Looking to read something a bit more casual, but still, you know, sciencey.

I have a decent baseline understanding of both pharmacology and immunology, but far from knowledgeable! Never really operated in oncology at all and I'd like to learn more about ADCs.

Sorry if this is a bit niche, any suggestions would be amazing.

:)

Comments:
- You're only going to find textbooks and journal articles on something that specific and scientific in nature. At least if you want anything more than wiki
- 1. "Antibody-Drug Conjugates: Fundamentals, Drug Development, and Clinical Outcomes to Target Cancer" by Kenneth J. Olivier and Grace Lee  
2. "Antibody-Drug Conjugates for Cancer Therapy" by L. Nathan Tumey

3. "The Chemistry of Antibody-Drug Conjugates" by Marc Damelin
