Title: Books on bioinformatics with python 

Content:
I'm looking for a book on applications of machine learning on bioinformatics using python. I found one by it was all math. 

Then there's one called 'deep learning for genomics " but that's for genomics

Are there any books that are on machine learning with python on bioinformatics?



Comments:
- So genomics is quite a big chunk of bioinformatics and knowledge you find there can be transfered one way or another to other sequence based problems and probably beyond. 

Are you looking for something specific? Just using machine learning without understanding math or how the methods work is basically using a blackbox. At that point you can just use a generic tool - which is totally fine btw.
- I'm actually really new to the field. What i eventually need is to be able to figure out a way by which i can detect if there's a propensity for disease by looking at the genome. 

I'm not sure if that's already been done or if there's a better way to do it

Thanks
- Generally, that's not an application for which you need AI.   There are thousands of genetic tests in use, and there are many ways of identifying de-novo mutations in the genome, and as far as I'm aware, AI would just be adding an unnecessary layer.
- Then what would be the potential applications of ai in genomics?
- Dunno.  

Why do you think there is one?
- Well i don't know enough about genomics to tell if there can be an application but based on the articles and books i can say there definitely is an application
- Sure - but I’ve been in the field long enough to remember the crapload of articles telling us about how blockchain will revolutionize genomics. I’m still waiting for a real application there too. 

AI is just a statistics model, and the flavour of the day.  People have been using complex statistics in sciences for a while, but there’s no reason to think LLMs will be a useful addition to that.
- Well, if I understand OP correctly he is not explicitly focusing on LLM's. As someone working primarily in AI+bioinformatics I would definitely argue that there are a lot use cases. Just think about basecallers, variant effect predictors... The list is quite endless. HyenaDNA is quite  impressive. 

 Nevertheless, i personally agree that the focus on AI in the last years was just adding unnecessary complexity to problems which could be/ are solved by classical ML/Stats methods.  DL makes only sense for complex problems and to tackle such, one needs a solid understanding of biology and DL. Applying model x to problem y is not going to bring you anywhere, because it was already done a thousand times. 


 And what is your background? Also just having 'great ideas' without the means to realize them is just dreaming - which also is fine by itself, but won't bring you far in research.

Edit: did not see that you defined your goals already
- Alright
Can you tell me where can I focus on if not here?
I'm trying to work in the health space.a startup idea if you will

Drug discovery?
- Sorry, were you asking me or OP about our background?   I know very well that great ideas are useless without great execution - I am currently on my second biotech startup.  Execution is everything!
- Bioinformatics is a huge field.  I can’t tell you where you should work, or what areas you’ll enjoy. That ball is in your court. 

Drug discovery + AI is oversaturated, and there’s a lot of indications that it doesn’t work. Given that that’s currently my field - I switched from genomics about 4 years ago - I can tell you that most pharma are really disappointed with AI’s lack of success in drug design.
- What about pharmacogenomics?
Can I use AI for precision medicine?
Does that work?
