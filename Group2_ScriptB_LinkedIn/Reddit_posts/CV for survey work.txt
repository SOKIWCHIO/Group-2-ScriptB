Title: CV for survey work

Content:
Hey yall I’ve been familiarizing myself with machine learning and such recently. Image segmentation caught my eyes as a lot of survey work I do are based on a drone aerial image I fly or a LIDAR pointcloud from the same drone/scanner. 

I have been researching a proper way to extract linework from our 2d images ( some with spatial resolution up to 15-30cm). Primarily building footprint/curbing and maybe treeline eventually. 

If anyone has useful insight or reading materials I’d appreciate it much. Thank you.
