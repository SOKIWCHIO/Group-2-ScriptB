Title: Can this HIV medicine also be used for PrEP?

Content:
Hi Folks!

This is a video from my YouTube series summarizing scientific papers. These are meant to be easier to digest for non-specialist audiences to help make primary scientific articles more accessible to everyone.

I am excited to share my latest video! This is a summary of the paper: Antibody-based CCR5 blockade protects Macaques from mucosal SHIV transmission.

It outlines the prophylactic capability of the HIV antiretroviral therapy medicine, Leronlimab (PRO 140), to protect Rhesus macaques from Simian-Human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). These data show how effective high and low doses of leronlimab are at protecting Rhesus macaques from SHIV infection. 

Any thoughts on the video are greatly appreciated. I hope that you enjoy learning about this interesting topic!
