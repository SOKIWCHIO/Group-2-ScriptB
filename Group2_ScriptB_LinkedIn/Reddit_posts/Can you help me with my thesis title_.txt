Title: Can you help me with my thesis title?

Content:
I am unsure about my current thesis title: Computational strategies in epilepsy genomics.

[My first study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37834093/) was a narrative review, "Applications for Deep Learning in Epilepsy Genetic Research".

My second study focused on optimising genetic sequencing in epilepsy using whole-genome sequencing data. Evaluated three variant callers and 8 structural variant callers using clinically validated variants. I increased the diagnostic yield in that study.

[My third study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5014142) focused on developing a machine learning polyvariant risk prediction model for cutaneous adverse drug reactions using whole-genome sequencing data. Improved the positive predictive value in that study.

[My fourth study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.24.25326321v1) focused on identifying dysregulated transcription factor activity in temporal lobe epilepsy using two gene regulatory network (regulon) detection methods (pySCENIC and hdWGCNA) and two independent single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets, a discovery and a validation dataset, each comprising epilepsy and healthy control hippocampal samples. Identified dysregulated transcription factors, which may represent potential drug targets.

The fourth study might be more transcriptomics than genomics. So, just using 'genomics' in the title may not be correct.

I was also thinking about alternative titles:

Computational Genomics and Transcriptomics Strategies to Improve Epilepsy Management.

Computational Strategies for Genomics and Transcriptomics Analysis to Improve Diagnosis and Precision Medicine in Epilepsy Management.

Suggestions are much appreciated.

Comments:
- Short/concise is good.

Make the title longer only if there is a clear need/benefit.

Good to discuss this with PI, who has more info ad context.
- "Computational Strategies in Epilepsy Genomics.: A Tale of Heartbreak, Mystery, and Triumph."
