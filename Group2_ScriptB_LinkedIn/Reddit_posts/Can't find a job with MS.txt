Title: Can't find a job with MS

Content:
I've been looking for months and sent out 100 applications now. I've probably gotten around 10-15 interviews but most the time its ghosting and never even looking at my application. My BS is in Microbio but was coursework I elected was more "environmental". So I took the hard courses like microbial genetics but electives were all field work, minor work with plants, food microbiology, water microbio, etc. I enjoyed learning fundamental constructs about nature and pathogens that live in our landscapes. 

My MS is Molecular Bio and I learned during this degree that I do not like biomedical type research and found my research topic boring. I felt like quitting so many times because I never could see myself doing this type of research. I got my PI to allow me to take microbiology courses instead, which are completely irrelevant to my research but it made things better. 

I wanted to stay in my state- there are 3 R1 universities here but industry insignificant. I thought I could find a job as a microbiologist at a cannabis testing lab (legal state) but when I apply to those, the job board will show me that 120 other people have also applied for that role and then  I never end up hearing back. I also applied to a pretty basic food science QC lab testing job- I did this type of work during my undergrad research and was rejected within an hour of applying. I checked the post 3 days later and saw it had 300 applicants. 

There's a few small biotech companies around here- making antibodies, PCR reagents, testing new lab equipment. I also would have been fine doing that, but I haven't heard back from any of them, despite seeing the companies re-list the same job for months on end. 

The graduating PhD students in my program are complaining about having the same issues. I see boat loads of jobs as lab techs in biomedical resesrch labs, but I have zero interest/pre-requiste knowledge about the given topic. Some of my friends are encouraging me to apply to these jobs, but I am worried it would be a bad idea to join a lab and hope to the flying spaghetti monster that you start liking it- that never happened to me during my MS so I am not confident it will happen now. During my whole MS, I felt sad all the time doing my lab work and wished I could go back to environmental work.

I've seen microbio/pathology related jobs come up in fish, Evolution, and plant labs  and I consistently will get interviews for these jobs, but they end up contacting me and tell me they've gone with someone who has more direct experience. 

What non-Biology jobs could I get as a new grad with only lab experience? I am not competent with coding. 
Is this a problem in other parts of the country too? 
I wanted to stay in my home state because I was so unhappy during my whole MS, I wanted to work and live close to my friends and family and do more fun things with them. The idea of starting over in a new place sounds terrible. 

Sorry for the typos- on my phone. 

Edit- country USA

- I don't know about biology but in other fields getting 10-15 interviews from 100 applications is great numbers.
- The job market is really tight right now. Unfortunately, a large number of people are applying to jobs they are not qualified/experienced to do, thus reading applications is becoming a huge burden in academia. 

Before you apply to a non-bio job, ask yourself what kind of job you really want. What type of work do you like doing every day? Bench, desk, combo, clinical? Strategize from what type of work fits your personality (independent or large group). Start examining labs in your state, is there a group that sounds interesting? Contact them‚Äîthey might be hiring even if they have not posted anything.
- I am tired i read ms as Multiple Sclerose.
- You‚Äôre not alone. The job market is garbage. I just finished a PhD in molecular bio and can‚Äôt find a job either. 60 applications and 3 interviews in, and nothing.
- Environmental lab work
I‚Äôd keep trying to get into plant/entomology lab work as it is country wide. Is there a USDA/ARS lab near you?
- >I see boat loads of jobs as lab techs in biomedical research labs, but I have zero interest

well there is your problem, you are getting a degree in molecular bio and don't want to even entertain the most abundant type of entry level micro-bio jobs

and to anyone else reading this, because god does this always come up.

get your BS first THEN ENTER THE LABOR MARKET, take a entry level job in a lab as a lab tech. You should not be getting a MS or god forbid a PhD when you barely even know what the field is about let alone if its the type of research and job environment you want to dedicate a life time to

the big problem with a MS.... is it has no point, the PhD has a point. But the MS makes you think you should now not be aiming for the very entry level jobs, but thats wrong. You are likely aiming for the same positions as BS grads as you also have no real job experience

in short, i guarantee you can find a job if you actually apply to those entry level lab tech/ research assistant positions either at a uni or at big pharma.

you don't have to, but then what are you complaining about that you didn't even graduate yet and already you are making a career change
- If you have interviewed over 10 times and not been hired, I strongly recommend thinking about how you are showing up in the interview. How are you presenting yourself? Are you highlighting your soft skills? As a hiring manager, I am looking for someone I want to work with every day. Someone my team will want to work with every day. I can teach the technical day to day skills. It is much harder to teach the soft skills. I often see candidates trying to sell me on their technical, especially with very junior and entry level positions. I want to know they have self-awareness, communicate effectively, pay attention to detail, and work well with others. Hope this helps with your next interview. Good luck!
- Same. The job market is hell right now. MS in Zoology and from Germany.

I feel you
- OP you need to move to where the jobs are. This is Boston/SF/SD. try to get a job as a research associate if you want to be at the bench. Other than that I'm not sure what jobs you're qualified for or could find. You have to target an industry that's actively hiring
- "100". Try 1000. It can be a numbers game at times. Make looking your full-time job
- Go work for a brewery running their yeast propagation
Lab, I get it it‚Äôs lab work but it‚Äôs way better‚Ä¶. And free beer. ü§∑ Maybe start checking internships in desired fields? Get some that ‚Äú5-10 years of experience‚Äù everyone wants college grads to have lol
- "I bet r/biology can help me"
- columbia public schools in missouri is needing ms science teachers
- Consider federal employment - a lot of jobs have ‚Äúrecent graduate pathways‚Äù openings for people such as yourself to get your foot in the door. They usually have internship opportunities that are paid. UDSA, FDA, EPA, USFWS, NOAA all hire microbiologists, and I‚Äôm sure other agencies as well.

Also, look into agriculture companies. My friend is a plant botanist working on CRISPR editing soybeans for tolerance. Big AG is not all bad. Bayer, Syngenta, ChemChina (nee Monsanto)
- You can try to apply for environmental jobs. All manufacturing companies have environmental safety officers. It would pay 40-65k at least here in Florida.
- The best role for you is in academics. There is a harsh reality about academic positions- they are challenging intellectually and pay the worst of the field by far. BUT you will get 1on1 attention every day from at least 1 brilliant scientist, and the opportunity to develop and experiment with new things/instruments/research in the field - you need this to re-interest you in a career in bio. They are amazing jobs if not for the pay. 

Look at unis in areas you could live in in the US (say goodbye to your home state but keep your 3 unis in your area on your watchlist). When they post new jobs, research the professors lab youre applying to, read their latest few publications and understand them. This will help you understand what you will be working on, and if you would be interested in it/be a good fit. 

Edit: Youll be able to find micro related positions at any university. Make sure its something your interested in

Apply to the job through the listing, then immediately email the professor directly. Have a CV/research statement prepared in addition to your resume attached to the email. Sell yourself, cite their latest research and how you would fit into the future directions of that. Do that succinctly - less than 12 sentences. 

I will gurantee you that you will get an email back, and 80% of the time youll get an interview. 

Good luck, let me know if you take my advice
- you could be a health inspector. google [your state] REHS
- The job market overall is fantastic, unemployment hasn't been this low in decades.  That won't change the fact that every year far more people graduate with bio degrees than there are entry level jobs in related fields.  It's been this way for a long time, no matter how good the market is most people with biology degrees struggle to find employment.  I'm sorry if people don't like this reality, but these are simple facts.
- Would you have any recommendations for someone just beginning their educational journey interested in that type of field? Like of specializations to pursue, skills to pick up, other disciplines to explore in tandem?
