Title: Cross-platform normalization enables machine learning model training on microarray and RNA-seq data simultaneously

Comments:
- How is this a Nature paper in 2023? "Do quantile normalization" seems relatively straight forward, and combining data modalities is often done, especially in the single-cell world.
- because nobody ran it on those methods and published it?
- The journal is communications biology which is in the nature publishing group.

This is not the same as the nature journal
- That's not true. Quantile normalization has been the norm in microarray processing for a while now, and was a common approach in RNA-seq workflows prior to things like DeSeq2
- but between both of them?
- There are numerous papers establishing the concordance between RNA-seq and microarrays dating back a decade:

- https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3001
- https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-629
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378111917305796

At the point where you have comparable measures with shared information, saying you can standardize scales across variables to find that shared information isn't particularly novel.

I'm not saying the paper doesn't have merit, just that it's weird it ended up in Nature, when novelty is suppose to be Nature's entire thing.
- Thanks for the info... Nature and other top journals have had much less of a barrier to entry over the past decade or so... it happens.
- This isn’t Nature though.

Look closer Lenny
- This is not a Nature article. It’s a Communications Biology article.
- yeah true, I didn't notice in light of the upset guy's comments
