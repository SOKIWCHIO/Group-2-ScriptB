Title: Cs masters vs stats masters vs bioinformatics masters

Content:
Hi y’all. I’m at a bit of a dilemma here. I am a current undergraduate biochem major with minors in stats and cs. I am currently doing research with graph theory and using knowledge graphs to store genetic information. I really like the stuff I’m doing and eventually I think I want to do a PhD in developing new algorithms and maybe do stuff with probabilistic modeling. 


Im also reading PRML and really enjoying it too so doing an applied machine learning PhD also might be an attractive option later. If I want to do either options would a cs masters, stats masters, or a bioinformatics masters be a great stepping stone? Ideally would be a PhD but my stats are pretty bad and I don’t have too much extensive research experience.

Comments:
- Stats wouldn't work. Sounds heavily algorithms based, which is a very specific sector of CS. If you can access that through a Bioinformatics program, that would be great. Algorithms is hard though, the domain knowledge required to write a competitive algorithm, the thickness of just genetic processing algo books. Going to take a lot of personal focus, regardless of what masters you take. 

Also there are more than a few people who are natural talents at bio, who really wouldn't need to go through the masters and should just be learning cs.
- Hey op. I’m kinda in the similar postion as you applying to grad schools right now. I would honestly reach out to advisors you like and ask directly. 




However I do find that many advisors in the fields you’re interested in, do prefer people with more quantitative backgrounds although it might not be impossible for you given your background.
- Thank you. Do you just suggest I do a pure cs masters then?
- Since you're going for a Phd I would reach out and ask directly what they would accept as credentials. But yes, that's what I would personally aim for. There's like 4-5 cs specific courses I have in mind. Deep learning, machine learning, algos, algos advanced, machine vision. All very time consuming and demancing courses.
