Title: DS Salary is mainly determined by geography, not your skill level

Content:
I have built a model that predicts the salary of Data Scientists / ML Engineers based on 23,997 responses and 294 questions from a 2022 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey.

Below are the feature importances from LGBM.

TL;DR: Country of residence is **an order of magnitude** more important than anything else (including your experience, job title or the industry you work in).

- Well, yeah.

If a job exists in a country it tends to pay relative to the cost of living in that country, or at least relative to how much other jobs in that country pay.

Also, no. You generally can't just work remotely for a US company and get the geographic pay difference. They'll want to pay you based on where they owe taxes on your income.
- This applies to every job so it isn't a surprise. An accountant in the US will usually earn more than the same profession in Nigeria (to pick a random place). Also most people can't easily move countries. You might as well remove geography from the data, and maybe we get something more insightful out of this.
- That's true for every job because cost of living and economic strength of a country determine average salary level.

So what's the feature importance if we account for that and which countries do pay less/more for DS relative to their median salary?
- This is a good example of what not to do as a data scientist. Putting data into a model and try to explain things without context.
- You better normalize salaries by average cost of living in that geography. I bet you'll end up getting a different insight.
- To compare US salaries with other countries‚Äô salaries is just bad DS. Even within the US, this doesn‚Äôt mean anything until cost of living takes into account.
- I suppose that‚Äôs true for most jobs

- You need to adjust for the purchasing power for each country, and look at net income (after tax, ect) and likely other soft benefits with each country. For example, a DS in Finland might have a lower salary but typically have other benefits like public healthcare that a DS in other countries \*cough\* America \*cough\* have to substitute with private healthcare.  


Also I always get suspicious when one feature has an extreme influence compared  to others. Maybe it gets explained with insight but typically means I have messed an assumption up and need to look into it more.
- No shit Sherlock. You don't need a model to tell this üòÇ
- Bad statistics as it does not consider multicollinearity or endogeneity.
- What feature importance are we looking at? Is this some split based importance? TreeSHAP? Something else?

That makes a wild difference in how we can interpret these findings.
- Please adjust for PPP. This is "bad statistics"

Edit or I'll do it. I doubt law of one price is failing that substantially, or there is arbitrage. Or both. I only hire south Americans etc because they do the same or better work for $20k a year instead of $180 + equity + complaining. As an executive, why would I spend company money that functionally is a housing investment for someone else in the bay area or NYC? I just want to build xyz feature, not buy pay someone's mortgage. That's the arb part. 

Employees I hire are happy, I'm happy.

Remote work was only good for Americans for a year. It turns out, remote work means substituting from nyc to talinn to improve output by 400%, not substituting nyc to Hudson for 20%.

Americans are either going to need to upskill, or get used to competing with international labor markets
- You didn‚Äôt need data science to know this.
- Next question is. Which countries??
- 1) Country is going to be the most relevant because you're switching currencies from local to USD without taking into account the purchasing power on each country. 

2) Country would probablybe better used as a blocking variable (source of known variance, but you do not care about its weight on the data). Similar to a pseudo-experiment. 

3) If you're making inference using the dependant variables, did you check if the assumptions of the model were violated? Or was it just an RMSE optimization on prediction?

Last part is pretty relevant imo, if a model is claiming inference on parameters, but did not worry about model assumptions or it's doing a non-parametric regression, then it's either wrong or there's not even a parameter to estimate.
- Americans buthurt realizing the world aint as meritocratic as they pretend it to be
- None of your factors are particularly great proxies for ‚Äúskill level‚Äù either though, I wouldn‚Äôt draw the second part of your conclusion. Having more experience is better than not but it‚Äôs very far from a guarantee of improvement.

You can code for decades but if you never care about quality you‚Äôre going to be outpaced by someone who thinks a lot about the best way to do things and constantly tries to improve. 

The ‚Äúscience‚Äù part of skill is really hard to get a handle on. Having the proper domain knowledge and being able to critically draw the correct conclusions is not something that happens automatically. Same thing for communication skills, honestly.
- How is something this terrible being upvoted in a subreddit supposedly for data **science**. No serious attempt at standardising measurements, causal claims with no attempt at isolating the effect or examining endogeneity. Just so buzzwords, this thread is pretty much the worst stereotype of a CS person trying to do data science with a less than a 101 grasp of statistics.
- Salaries in the US are ridiculously high. What else is new?
