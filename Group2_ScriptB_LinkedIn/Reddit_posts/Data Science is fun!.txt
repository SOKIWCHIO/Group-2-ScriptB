Title: Data Science is fun!

Content:
Hi everyone, I’m a marketing major about to graduate in May. A year and a half ago I took basic hypothesis testing/linear modeling class to try out an analytics certificate at my school, and I fell in love with statistics for the first time. When I began looking for job/internship opportunities around that time I was worried because while I didn’t mind marketing, I also didn’t love it. That’s when I made the decision to continue my degree in business, and work every week towards becoming a data analyst (and eventually, a data scientist! But I’m patient, and I wanted to wait until I’m ready. There’s a lot to statistics/programming, as I now know… lol). 

It’s been a long and *very* hard road. But I now have a job as a data analyst and I’m working on a large machine learning personal project now. I see a lot of negative discussion in this sub (which is entirely fair); however, I just wanted you all to know that as someone who is not taking the traditional route into data science, I think your job is awesome. I think what you do is fascinating and what statistical modeling might accomplish in the future is inspiring. Have a great day, and I hope I have the pleasure of meeting some of you in the field one day.

- A positive attitude and belief in yourself can get you further than a PhD sometimes. Keep it up and excited for the impact you'll make!

- It’s an alright role. I’ve realized the respect given to data analysts is pretty pathetic. Because no one knows how to combine the data it actually hurts you because when ever you do a complicated analysis no give a fuck. I’ve gotten more praise on project I spent 5 minutes on then projects I spent 5 months. Because of this, I really want to move on.
- Its fun for you because you love what you're doing. And that should be the case for everyone
- You should consider data scientist roles in advertising/marketing companies. Lots of good applications. I’m a statistician but became more interested in the marketing applications actually
- You're so sweet. As a current CS Major i love this.
- OP, it seems to me, you will go far because you have something many lack, and that is curiosity, a desire to explore and self improve, and a sense of fun. I hope you never lose that. Don't let the naysayers take you down, and someday you may change your little corner of the world.
- You're doing great!

Marketing departments need more data science. Work on projects with actionable data that can be consumed across the department. Targeted campaigns for leads and customers are very popular.
- It’s great that you have found something you enjoy! What is your ML project on?
- I'm so happy to hear that you enjoy it! It's great to find something that you actually like doing. I also pinch myself sometimes, thinking that what I do is so intellectually interesting (relative to other careers I might have done). I guess to each their own!
- Love reading this!

With a positive mind like yours you will certainly overcome all the upcoming challenges with a breeze.

Wish you the best of luck!
- DS and marketing are a great match for better or for worse, FWIW.
- Well done.
This is a W post.
- It's very engaging and that's why the space can be so crowded. Find something you really enjoy and be sure to pair it with other top skills you have (domain expertise is very valuable), and you'll make a good road for yourself.
- Don’t give up
- I agree !
- That's great to hear!
- Sounds like you'd be a great colleague! Congrats finding a path you're enthusiastic about (not everyone does), and good luck transitioning into your future roles.
- As someone who teaches math and stats majors, it’s always fun to see when people find something new they like. Keep up that yearn to learn unabashedly and don’t let any naysayers get you down. 

The ability to learn new things, and to have that belief and confidence that you are capable of doing that, is an incredibly important skill.
- Keep it up, OP! You've got the spirit.
