Comments:
- This feature is a game-changer for problem-solving, makes complex issues more digestible and achievable!
- Is Deep-ML suitable for beginner?
- How common are these of questions on interviews?
- Looks cool. I’ll check it out
- The most important skill for data science is understanding which data and corresponding inferences based on the data have potential to be useful to business. Not any of this crap.
- i was actually looking for leetcode style for ML. How's this site? and How's te community?
- Am I expected to know this for interviews?
- dumb q but how can i print to the console when debugging??? it isn't showing the things i print which makes debugging much harder
- I’d say beginners could solve easy questions with help from the learn section
- not super common currently, but I am hearing more and more places are starting to ask these types of questions
- Try this one, [https://www.aiofferly.com/](https://www.aiofferly.com/). I'm using it and I think it has more real interview questions.
- Great, the shitty interview practice of doing lazy and irrelevant school tests and forcing candidates to grind this crap has spread from SWE to DS market
