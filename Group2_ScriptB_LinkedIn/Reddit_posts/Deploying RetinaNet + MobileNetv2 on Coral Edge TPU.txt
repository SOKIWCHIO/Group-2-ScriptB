Title: Deploying RetinaNet + MobileNetv2 on Coral Edge TPU

Content:
Hey everyone! I’m currently working on a machine learning project and wanted to get some insights from the community.

I’m building a seed classification and detection system using RetinaNet. While its default backbone is ResNet50, I plan to deploy the model on a Raspberry Pi 5 with a USB Coral Edge TPU. Due to hardware limitations, I’m looking into switching the backbone to MobileNetV2, which is more lightweight and compatible with Edge TPU deployment.

I’ve found that RetinaNet does allow custom backbones, and MobileNetV2 is supported (according to Keras), but I haven’t come across any pretrained RetinaNet + MobileNetV2 models or solid implementation references so far.

The project doesn’t require real-time detection—just image-by-image inference—so I’m hoping this setup will work well. Has anyone tried this approach? Are there any tips or resources you can recommend?

Comments:
- Put that Coral Edge TPU in the trash and get yourself the Pi AI Hat with Hailo-8 accelerator.   You will save yourself all the hassle you propose.
- Never heard of the Hailo-8 accelerator before but I will definitely try it out. You just saved me the hassle. Thank you so much!
