Title: Doubts about my studies: fellow biologists pls help me

Content:
Small context: 20 years old, from italy and based in italy.

Here we go, it's a little long.

  
Two years ago, when I enrolled in the Biology bachelor, I did so with the vague yet fervent idea of becoming a "protector of nature."

It was a vague notion, I admit, but one filled with enthusiasm. I envisioned immersing myself in a vast field of study, gradually understanding and mastering it so that I could one day step into a forest and confidently say, "I know how this works and how to help it thrive. I know how to protect it from humans—or at least help it coexist with us as harmoniously as possible."

As time passed, I encountered some challenges.

For instance, I realized that I struggle to enjoy or easily navigate the rigor of scientific literature and terminology.

More importantly, as I delved deeper into my studies, gained field experience, and engaged with research realities, I began to see that I lack a genuine and spontaneous passion for nature’s intricate workings in their finest details.

I mean the specificity of it all:

Even tho i knew it (university and academics are about DEEP learning after all), i guess i didn't really see it coming. 

It's just that, while doing it, i realized i was more the guy to look at national geographic ad think "wow, cool", than the guy to spend hours and hours looking at population growth graphs, or understanding the evolution of teeth structure in mammals since their appearance, or get deep into the structure and functioning of a specific bunch of enzymes.

And this lack of interest, that sometimes manifests itself, deadly joins with a matter of motivation:

Much of what I study feels self-contained: there’s nothing wrong with pursuing knowledge for its own sake if it inspires passion, but it doesn’t inspire me enough to fully dive into its purity out of sheer interest.



I believe people are drawn to what they can use, transform, or ultimately benefit from. This applies to my studies as well.

Do I really want to safeguard a species or ecosystem just for the sake of doing so? Simply for the satisfaction of knowing, as I go to bed, that I’ve preserved some untouched corner of nature?

Is that corner truly "untouched" if human intervention was required to keep it that way?

What does "untouched" even mean? Does it refer to how it was before modern humans? Is it feasible—or even sensible—to ensure that certain places remain free of human influence?

If the goal is to protect these areas from interference, then shouldn't we save them and then forget about them, letting them exist and evolve on their own? This is a noble approach, and I recognize its virtue, but I struggle to embrace an initiative that lacks practicality and concrete utility.

I struggle to embrace an initiative that lacks practicality and concrete utility. Nature and its dynamics, in and of themselves, do not ignite enough passion in me to delve deeply into them or work with them deliberately out of pure enthusiasm. I cannot help but wonder if such efforts are ultimately futile—too small to stand against the relentless machine of urban expansion and capitalist interests.

For me, to wholeheartedly and intensely apply my intellect to mastering naturalistic or conservation biology, I need to see its practical value beyond its moral principle. I need to see myself in a meaningful role, to think, "These studies and this knowledge make me someone who contributes to the development and well-being of the community in X way." I hope there is more to this than merely earning a degree that qualifies me to manage a park where families picnic on Sundays. Please tell me it's more than beautiful words spoke to unbothered world leaders and a source of recreation and picturesque photographs for trekking enthusiasts.



More examples.

I had the opportunity to study abroad on an Erasmus exchange program at a Polish university:

I had a professor in Applied Ecology that spends much of his life monitoring bat populations in a forest, capturing them, counting them, and measuring their dimensions.

A fellow student was thrilled at the mere prospect of spotting a particular bird species.

Another professor devoted his entire career to identifying a single enzyme in a single plant species.

Another professor, in my home university, devoted his whole adult life to studying one single kind of ions channels.

I deeply respect the passion that drives people to engage so deeply with nature, whether on a macroscopic, microscopic, or molecular level, but I find it hard to relate. Said in french, sometimes i can't help but think "Sorry but idgaf", after a certain level of specificity is reached.

At least, not in its "pure just for the sake of it" form.



One last thing, which i realize carries a big "just change bachelor man" weight.

If the slightest contribution, comes after years of research… sorry, it ain't for me.

We are back to the "interest" part. I can't see myself in a lab or on the field spending years collecting data and battling with statistics and informatics in order to find out about an ultra specific crumble of something, or just reviewing and confirming or denying what others said.

Yeah, maybe i don't really like science and its ways after all? Idk, i just hoped there was a way to get a "biological" job without getting ultra deep in academics and reserach.

Other than this, the whole "motivation" stuff.



Having made this confession, I now return to the purpose of this post.

I would greatly appreciate if any of you could share recommendations, share experiences, suggest readings, whatever, that might help me rediscover and reevaluate the role, purpose, and place of ecologists, environmentalists, naturalists, and biologists in our world.

Help me better understand the tangible contributions they make to healthy development, quality of life, and the value of civilization.

Help me see what biodiversity truly represents and why, beyond principle alone, it must be defended in all its forms, without leaving anything out.

Thank you for your time and consideration, sorry if i repeated myself along the post.





P.S.

Yes, i know that genetists, biotechs, bio-medical researchers, igienists, have a more easy-to-see role considered the direct line linking their field to human health, other than being responsible of the centers analyizing your blood and pee when needed.

It still seems far from actual society-changing innovations, and requiring of that whole researching abnegation backed by sheer passion i see lacking in myself… at least at the moment.

- There are many other vocations that can contribute to the welfare of wildlife without having to be a biologist. You could get into public policy, for example, and work for the equivalent of the EPA in your country.
- "a world without movie theatre cashiers" - I heard that in a Don LaFontaine voice in my head.
