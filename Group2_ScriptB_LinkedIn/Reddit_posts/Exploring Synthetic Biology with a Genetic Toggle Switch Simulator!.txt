Title: Exploring Synthetic Biology with a Genetic Toggle Switch Simulator!

Content:
ðŸš€ Exploring Synthetic Biology with a Genetic Toggle Switch Simulator! ðŸ§¬I built a simple interactive app to simulate and visualize the behavior of a synthetic genetic toggle switch, a key component in synthetic biology and genetic engineering.Using a mathematical model based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), this app allows users to: âœ… Adjust protein production rates âœ… Modify repression strength âœ… Set initial protein concentrations âœ… Control the total simulation timeWhether you're a researcher, student, or just curious about synthetic biology, feel free to experiment with it and explore how gene regulation works! ðŸ”¬âœ¨ðŸ’¡ If you're interested, check it out and let me know your thoughts![hashtag#SyntheticBiology](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23syntheticbiology&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#GeneticCircuits](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23geneticcircuits&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#Bioengineering](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23bioengineering&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#ComputationalBiology](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23computationalbiology&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#Biotech](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23biotech&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#Simulation](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23simulation&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#MachineLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23machinelearning&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#ScienceTech](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23sciencetech&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED)
