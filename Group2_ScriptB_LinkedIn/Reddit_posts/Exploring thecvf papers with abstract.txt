Title: Exploring thecvf papers with abstract

Content:
When I was exploring the papers on the openaccess.thecvf.com website, I was confused with that I canâ€™t read abstract text without leaving the current page.
So, I developed a Chrome/Edge extension for showing the abstract text in the paper list page.
