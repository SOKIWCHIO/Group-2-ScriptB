Title: Extract Log-Normalised Data From a Seurat Object

Content:
I am working in R and I have een given a Seurat pipeline for processing some 10x scRNA-seq data. As a part of the Seurat pipeline the \`NormalizeData\` command was run, with the option \`normalization.method = "LogNormalize"\`. 

I want to perform machine learning on the counts data and want to access the log normalised counts after all the processing in the Seurat object. I tried running \`GetAssayData()\` but this doesn't seem to be log-normalised (or maybe it is and I'm confused, but most of the entries are still 0). How can I get this processed counts matrix out?

Thanks

Comments:
- check the max of your matrix, if it's an integer in the 100s or 1000s you have the raw counts, if it's like 13.6374657 you have lognorm.

lognorm is log(norm counts + 1) so has the same number of zeros as the raw counts matrix.
- For log normalised counts itâ€™s the data slot of your assay.
- There is a good wiki of the Seurat data object and information about the slots and objects can be found here: https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/wiki
- You have been given good advice here. I just wanted to ask which version of Seurat are you using? If I am remembering correctly accessing the log normalized counts may have changed slightly over revisions. If you are using a pipeline that was given to you and is using an older version of Seurat make sure you look up documentation for the correct version. [https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Seurat/](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Seurat/) is what I use.
