Title: Flow Cytometry and BIoinformatics

Hey there,  
After doing the gating and preprocessing in FlowJo, we usually export a table of marker cell frequencies (e.g., % of CD4+CD45RA- cells) for each sample.

My question is:  
Once we have this full matrix of **samples × marker frequencies**, can we apply post hoc **bioinformatics or statistical analyses** to explore **overall patterns**, like correlations with clinical or categorical parameters (e.g., severity, treatment, outcomes)?

For example:

* PCA or clustering to see if samples group by clinical status
* Differential abundance tests (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, ANOVA)
* Machine learning (e.g., random forest, logistic regression) to identify predictive cell populations
* Correlation networks or heatmaps
* Feature selection to identify key markers

Basically: is this a valid and accepted way to do **post-hoc analysis** on flow data once it’s cleaned and exported? Or is there a better workflow?

Would love to hear how others approach this, especially in clinical immunology or translational studies. Thanks!

- ... this is what everyone has been doing? For example:

- of course, why wouldn't it be? you're just describing hypothesis-free approaches.
- I'm interested in seeing the responses you will get. I have thought the same
- I convert those table outputs to Prism format for statistics using this app I made. Just quickly visually scan through the plots that come out from this too to see if they're interesting.
