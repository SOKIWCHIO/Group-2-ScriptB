Title: For the first time, I have seen a job post appreciating having Coursera certificates.

- Is this good or bad?
- Sun shines on a something something every once in a while. I like talking to candidates about how they've broadened/deepened their horizons with these courses during later interviews but I can't use it as any kind of instrument early in the application process (they are too easy and there's no guarantee the candidate learned anything from them, really).

Credentialing is all over the place. Only reason I even care about a 4-8 year degree credentials is they tend to let me cut the stack of candidates down by 50-75%. I didn't do that before I started getting 1,000+ applications for every open position (post-pandemic).
- This subreddit has an extremely skewed idea of how job postings are written. HR works with the manager of the team that needs a hire to put together a job description and list of qualifications. The postings you see reflect the personal preferences of that particular manager. They are made by actual people.
- From my interviews I've had, people have viewed having [Deeplearning.ai/Coursera](https://Deeplearning.ai/Coursera) certificates favorably. It's along the lines of "Oh I know others that did those courses".
- Surely they would consider my MSDS then. Link please?
- You dont really get a degree for the skills, you get it for the accolades.

Most jobs want to see accolades unfortunately.

Been that way for decades.
- Has anyone heard of udemy
- Oh
- Maybe now some of my certs will matter.
- I think (and hope) that more companies appreciate it, but not all of them mention it in a job offer ðŸ˜ƒ
- Becoming the future ðŸ¤¯
- idk Iâ€™ve mostly heard negative feedbacks on coursera
- Man I was still worried. Iâ€™m very interested in studying this area but I donâ€™t think I want to pay another 50-60k and two year full time. But according to how you phrase it, which means Coursera etc still not recognized by the majority employers? Is it any better today?
- Woohoo, Iâ€™ve got a few of those. I wonder if I should put something similar in for the positions Iâ€™m advertising.
- If so... then what about Kaggle Course Certification?
- Surprised no one mentioned some of those cert can be used as bachelor or master credits like ap classes in high school

I do agree that  you can cheat whereever you are, weather you are in cert class or college class though, or other situations...
- Education and knowledge shouldnâ€™t require gatekeeping from fancy expensive institutions.
- Good for those who don't have the money to spend to go to university. Bad for those who want to gatekeep because they are still paying student debts.
