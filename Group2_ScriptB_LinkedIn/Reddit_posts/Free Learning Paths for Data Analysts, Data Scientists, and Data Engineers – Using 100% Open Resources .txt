Title: Free Learning Paths for Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers – Using 100% Open Resources 

Content:
Hey, I’m Ryan, and I’ve created 

https://www.datasciencehive.com/learning-paths 

a platform offering free, structured learning paths for data enthusiasts and professionals alike.

The current paths cover:

	•	Data Analyst: Learn essential skills like SQL, data visualization, and predictive modeling.
	•	Data Scientist: Master Python, machine learning, and real-world model deployment.
	•	Data Engineer: Dive into cloud platforms, big data frameworks, and pipeline design.

The learning paths use 100% free open resources and don’t require sign-up. Each path includes practical skills and a capstone project to showcase your learning.

I see this as a work in progress and want to grow it based on community feedback. Suggestions for content, resources, or structure would be incredibly helpful.

I’ve also launched a Discord community (https://discord.gg/Z3wVwMtGrw) with over 150 members where you can:

	•	Collaborate on data projects
	•	Share ideas and resources
	•	Join future live hangouts for project work or Q&A sessions

If you’re interested, check out the site or join the Discord to help shape this platform into something truly valuable for the data community.

Let’s build something great together.

- This is awesome 👏 👏
- Wow this post received a lot more attention than I was anticipating! Thank you all so much for the kind words! Like I said still a work in progress that I will try to improve. If anyone has questions, feel free to reach out to me! I’ll be happy to help if I can!
- So is data analyst something like a less advanced version of data scientist?
- Hey Ryan, I am trying to PM you but it doesn't seem to go through, can I start a chat with you?
- When I click on the paths, they take me to a blank page. Is this an error on my end, or is this info to be filled out later?
- Thank you, awesome Human!
- It's showing the link to Join discord server is expired.. Can you please check on that?
- Thank you for this! It's awesome! I'm currently a high school math teacher and recently started teaching a Data Science course. I've learned so much and want to continue to develop my skills and understanding. I'm so tired of the students' attitudes and apathy. I'm hoping I can get enough experience to get out of the classroom and become a data scientist full time.
- Great job
- That's amazing  work, Ryan! Keep it up!!
- This is very nice!
- This appeared to me in the right moment. For the next month or so, I'll study this paths, starting from the data analyst one, and maybe do all of them. When I make proper progress, I'll update this comment!
- Looks amazing. I am currently a data scientist but I want to upskill so that I can fit other data roles should the need arise. I'll definitely try out the data engineer course.
- Thank you for sharing this!
- This is amazing, much needed!
- Love you Ryan! Keep doing Great Stuff!!
- Hey thanks for this 🙏
- Holy shite, dude … thank you
- thank you
- Thank you so much This is exactly what I have been looking for . I joined your discord and I will be active in there 😄👏
