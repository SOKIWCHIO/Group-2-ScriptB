Title: From bioinformatics to tool dev

Content:
I am a PhD grad student in bioinformatics with experience in development and maintenance of databases and genome browsers. I also have experience in pipeline dev, genome assembly, annotation and other downstream steps. I’ve also used machine learning for genomic feature extraction. 
I really enjoy(ed) working on the various projects I am/was involved in, but I like building products (databases, web apps and such) the most. What I really want to work on in the future is bioinformatics tool development, but that might be a bit of a hurdle for me since I’m not from a computer science background. 
I would really appreciate any advice on how to make this transition.

Comments:
- Looked at your post history to get a little more context.

You're going to learn a lot in the next several years of your PhD but something that your program and PI probably won't teach you is best development practices.

Don't go overboard and become dogmatic but get used to writing unit tests and being able to setup basic CI/CD pipelines that are appropriate for your work.

Try to open source what you can and strive to make everything a 'one click install' for someone who would be familiar with the format you're shipping.

I've done the above myself for my niche and it's really helped my career.

What's the first tool you'd want to build?
- I think it's cool you identify an interest in tool dev. Its a totally different experience building tools compared to say, writing just enough code to make the next figure for a paper
- CS background is irrelevant. I have a PhD in microbiology and I have developed a tool.
- Thanks for your advice! 

Right now I will work on the development of a genome browser tool to view annotated genomes, compare genomes and do other sorts of analysis. 
On this same project I would also incorporate a query functionality to search for specific sequences and features in genomic databases, and do set operations on the data (union, intersection and such).

Gradually I would want to move on to other stuff like sequence alignment, gene expression analysis and sequence assembly tools, which would be a totally new domain for me.
- What's the main programming language you use for developing tools?
- Yes I know, tool dev is like proper SD! Also, what do you do?
- Would you mind telling me about the tool you developed?
- Would also love to hear your new tool if you don’t mind me asking
- Personally I think any language is fine as long as there are unit tests and one line installs. Makes it really easy to port functions between languages.

I mainly use Go. Go has a releaser tool called go releaser that makes it really easy to ship binaries for every architecture/OS combo.

It also has example tests via the std library which make it really easy to write docs that never rot.

The only big drawback I've had is that people keep asking me why my work isn't written in python or R but that usually becomes clear after they see how easy it is to get setup with compared the virtual env thing python has going on.

Oh and generics are not too good in Go yet.

tldr programming style is more important than language imo and Go lets me write in a style I like.
- I actually work on a genome browser (jbrowse) and previously worked on model organism databases. It's an interesting niche...i could definitely ramble about it for awhile. My first entry into the field was a undergrad thesis with a lot of R plots and it was a very different experience
- I'm sorry but I can't disclose that without jeopardizing my anonymity.
- You’re part of the team who maintains jbrowse?? No way I used jbrowse to build a web-app to visualize certain genomes and their annotated products; genomes  which were either scraped from NCBI or assembled in-house !  This was the first publication of my life and it was related to analysis of SSRs and other domains and motifs in these genomes.
- Of course I understand..I was not asking for the exact tool just a general idea of what it does ..no issues my man!
- love that :) I have been tangentially involved with jbrowse as an open source project since \~2013 and got actually hired to help make jbrowse 2 more recently
- Keep up the great work ! Also, if you don’t mind me asking, what is your career trajectory? Like how did you start and all…
- sent ya a DM :)
