Title: Gameplay to Design DNA? [R]

Content:
We are developing a new machine learning algorithm that can design DNA by watching gameplay. The way humans play is different from computers, and that signal might be useful for searching DNA subspaces.

We will be writing a research paper on this new technique, and are shooting for Nature Biotechnology! DM if youâ€™d like to see the preprint.

We have a Tetris clone that runs a lightweight ML model on device, and actually designs DNA as you play. Here we are looking for DNA that activates PPARG::RXRA, involved in metabolism, and deactivates NFKB1, a key regulator of inflammation and immune. These DNA may promise to advance diabetes research.

Long term, we would like to have a library of games, even first person shooters, that design DNA in the background. Sound crazy? Maybe. But we think it might work.

Help us advance this research by collecting your anonymous play data!
