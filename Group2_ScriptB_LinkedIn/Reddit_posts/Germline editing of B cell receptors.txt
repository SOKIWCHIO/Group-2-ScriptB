Title: Germline editing of B cell receptors

Content:
Hi Folks, I am excited to share my latest video with you!

This is a summary of the paper:  Multiplexed CRISPR/CAS9-mediated engineering of pre-clinical mouse models bearing native human B cell receptors. 

In this video, I outline steps used to create broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies by utilizing a single-step CRISPR/Cas9 approach to genetically edit B cell receptors. These data show the functional responses of the edited B cells in a live animal model. 

Any thoughts on the video are greatly appreciated. I hope that you enjoy learning about this interesting topic!

This is a video from my YouTube series summarizing scientific papers. These are meant to be easier to digest for non-specialist audiences to help make primary scientific articles more accessible to everyone.
