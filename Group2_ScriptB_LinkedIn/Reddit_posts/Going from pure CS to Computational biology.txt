Title: Going from pure CS to Computational biology

Content:
Hello everyone

Can anyone tell me how one would go about getting into the field of computational biology if one has a pure computer science background (that means no biology after school whatsoever). I've seen professional online who went from a non-bio background (electrical and mechanical engineering) to careers as bio-statisticians with some machine-learning and stats experience. I've been interested in The Genome Project and genetics for a while, but only as a dilettante and have not been able to pursue the interest heavily because of life and job demands. I know of Applied Biostatistics course I can enrol myself in with my engineering background. Are there any other avenues I'm missing?

Is there any sort of road-map for the field?

Comments:
- I am not trying to sound bitter or incensed , but my comments simply reflect the reality of the field now as I continue to work in it. The thing is, it isn't all that interesting anymore. The field of biological research has changed significantly, even in the last 20 years, and not for the better. Most of the work now is insignificant extensions of prior results of dubious significance. So you want to design workflows for RNAseq data, or apply more boring algorithms to data to try to squeeze out some significance? That isn't likely to yield much satisfaction for you, as I can almost guarantee with 100% confidence the work you do will not have any significant impact on the field. Research in biologic fields are less and less about paradigm shifts or new significant knowledge(mainly because we kind of know everything now), and more about publishing minor extensions of work and or applications of that work to justify our existence. Most of the scientists that do biostats in genetics at my institution have PhDs in genetics or a bio science, because it's easier to learn the CS than the biology. That doesn't mean you can't it's just not really worth it TBH. Likely what you will be doing is carrying out what someone else wants you to do, so you really don't need much education in genetics or biology, and that is why there are experts in that, so you don't have to know everything. My advice, just apply. We are more desperate for folks to do the programmming and apply new stat models etc, than we are for people understanding the biology. That said, you will have a hard time competing in academics simply because the biostat grad students are easy to hoover up since they had access to all of it while getting their education. Don't worry too much, we are all living our lives of quiet desperation. You are not alone. I remember when the biochem dept hired a new math faculty member to use math for enzyme substrate docking. Another flash in the pan, and 20 years later not much of interest published  Molecular docking just doesn't work well. Things to think about.
- One way to get into the field is to find a CS job in a biotech company or academic research center ( much harder) - I notice there are bioinformatics job posting particularly from the big pharma advertised as software engineer or data scientist/engineer. They are either looking for a webdev to develop some (vitalization) web tool or straight-up data engineer for pipeline development either deployed on cloud or HPC.  Once you get a job like that, then you can take additional online courses or learn from the job to make up the knowledge gap in bioinformatics/ specific domain biology.
- You should have a clear idea of what it is you want to do first. If you just go into it naively, you'll probably end up doing stuff similar to what you'd do in a regular software development position but with significantly less pay, so you need to have a clear goal in mind because otherwise, like other users have said, you'll probably just be doing what biologists with phds tell you to do. In fact, for that very reason, not having a bio background actually doesn't matter for bioinformatics, because the actual biology will mostly be done by biologists anyway. Regardless of how cool and interesting it sounds on paper, it's still a tiny niche field with limited job opportunities.
- Is it easy to make that transition? I’m working in basically regular software development now too (have an engineering BS). I’ve considered a bioinformatics MS to change careers into the field but that’s a lot of time and $$. I’ve seen the listings you’re talking about though, working on websites the NIH uses to store gene data and whatnot, which don’t really involve data analysis or have to know anything about biology as they’re basically regular software dev jobs, but could still be cool nonetheless. Is it really possible to further transition into more “real” bioinformatics from those jobs without a formal biology education? That would be sweet!
- Nothing is easy.  Like you said, getting an full time MS is a more straightforward way to go but that cost you money and risking your job sercurity for a lower paid job . It is possible to make the transition but you need to look for opportunities for collabration at work. In other word,  not only you need to do your job well but also need to put in extra time and effort on the stuff you want to work on.   You are not gonna get those opportunities if you work in a regular tech company for sure. PhD is another conventional route you might want to consider - I didn't take it and I work twice as hard and it took me double the time to get to where i want to be ( a staff scientist level). I also know a guy who spent five years to transition from a lab tech to bioinformatics analyst with just BS degree.
