Title: Graduating in May - kind of freaking out.

Content:
Hey all, senior in Biology here graduating in May. I'm not gonna lie, I don't feel very optimistic looking at job prospects. Seems as if my only options are to pursue further education or to be a lab tech making oligos  all day for 40k/yr. One good thing is that my GPA is pretty good, so I could pursue pretty much anything I want. I just don't know what I want. 

I guess this post doesn't add anything new to the depressed upperclassman rhetoric, it's just that it kinds of sucks to work your ass off on a science degree and have nothing to show for it other than a piece of paper coming out of the other side.

I don't regret learning about Biology, and I loved every second of it. But looking at my business school friends that spent semesters abroad and boozed 4 days a week land cushy jobs while I have nothing to show for the weekends I spent toiling over orgo is pretty disheartening. Sorry for being a debby downer, I just needed somewhere to post this. Anyone else feeling the same way? How do you deal with the uncertainty of the future?

Comments:
- I know this is maybe a bit of left-field suggestion and I unsure how much it would appeal to you but after I graduated with my Masters in Molecular Medicine I decided to pack lab work in and went to work in a Sales based role at a big Lab consumables/reagents company.

It's 9-5 Monday to Friday and the pay is really decent. I kind of feel a little cheap; like i've sold out and turned my back on Science but I still get to speak about Biology/Research constantly with all the labs I talk with on a daily basis and it's much less disheartening than continuing to fuck up Western Blots for minimal pay.
- Pleasant evening the honest gather and where gentle month lazy? The simple night then movies night net open?
- Do you have lab experience? I have 2 years of experience yet I haven't been able to get even a $30k job in the biotech industry since getting my BS in biochemistry in May. Start applying now because after graduation there will be a lot more positions opening but also a LOT of other people in the same position.
- So team, what do we do now?
- I sold out.

I'm a production manager at a food manufacturing plant.

I make awesome money, but don't use any of my bio degree and barely my brain at all :|
- Hey mate, I graduated last year (Cons. Biol and Zool DM) and haven't as yet been employed in the field. I have literally seen about 10-15 entry level positions and unfortunately didn't get offered any of those positions that I applied for. Of course there have been times where I wonder if I made the right choice with my studies and whether it was worth it or not, but at the end of the day it was a field that I was interested in and something that I enjoyed pursuing. 

Regardless of if I get a job or not with my degree it is still worth it in my books, because it has shaped the way that I think and the way I perceive the world. To me it isn't about what specifics you learn in science but the way you reach conclusions and how you look at problems. I am now at a point where I am confident in my own abilities where if I hadn't studied I wouldn't. Now the degree I have is not a finishing point at all, it is a starting point. Take what you learnt and start applying it to your life, use it to be valuable in whatever career you fall into and it will be valuable.

More specific to me, which you may find valuable, is that I now realize I need to have a portfolio of work that I can show a potential employer to prove I am of value. I also realize that I need to pursue something that will be in demand, I am trying to be accepted into a Masters course in a similar but more employable field, Environmental Engineering. If I do get accepted it will not be a holiday, it will be work. It will be an opportunity to create a body of work, to show what I can do. 

Hopefully this perspective can give you some solace in what you have done, and some hope and confidence in what you will do.
- I'm in first year, and this makes me feel like shit. I'm doing really well, it's alot of work, but I just know my friends in business and commerce have it much easier and are going to make so much more money than me.
- I felt the same way before I graduated. I just graduated last June and moved back to San Mateo (near San Francisco). Quite a few of my friends who graduated with business-related degrees landed jobs paying ~65k/year. On the other hand, my friends with biology degrees still can't find jobs. They were decent students with solid experience.

My older friends with biology degrees eventually found lab jobs that pay around $18/hour, which is not a lot in the SF bay area. There also isn't much upward mobility with those jobs. Now a lot of them are applying for optometry school, dental school, clinical lab science programs, etc.

I ended up enrolling in a year-long computer science BS program after teaching myself some beginner programming. I always liked biology, but my skills are more suited towards computer science. You should try to see what you really like doing whether it be biology-related or not. I'm in no position to tell you what path to take (especially because I'm only a year older than you), but here are some options I've considered:


* Taking a lab job and shadowing professionals such as physicians and dentists in the meantime. 

* Taking a lab job and applying for a CLS program.

* Strengthening programming skills in Python, R, and Perl to become prepared for bioinformatics/sequencing jobs.

* Going a completely different route and applying for business analyst, business development, or sales positions.
- Do you have any interest in field biology? There are always field tech positions open, and my experience is that they really like people with lab or microbiology experience (I don't have any). Yes, most of these jobs are temporary, but so are all jobs. At least with these, you know in advance when they will end.

Here's a couple of job boards you might consider:

Good luck!
- I'm sort of in the same shoes except im graduating in a couple of weeks. I was unaware of how hard it is for a recent bio graduate when I started my degree and am now kind of regretting it. I've thought of a couple of options in order to not live with a crappy wage for the rest of my life: my main one is applying to physician assistant masters programs (since I took all the pre-reqs), accelerated nursing programs, clinical/medical lab scientist/technologist accelerated and or certificate programs, masters in computer science in a program that accept non comp sci graduates and can be completed in 2 years (I took about 4 comp sci courses as an undergrad), bioinformatics masters program (because there's no way im spending 5 - 7 years of my life for a PhD). I even considered going for Boston College's masters of engineering program for non-engineering undergrads, the only problem being that I would need to refresh my math starting with arithmetic. Honestly at this point in my life, having switched majors 3 or 4 times and having spent 6 friggin years as an undergrad I just want any job that will pay good and is in demand. The program that chooses me will be the program I go to...because all of them are quite interesting to me. 

Don't worry about being a downer, I feel like a good amount of us bio majors have or will be feeling this. You have a HUGE amount of opportunities, choose one and go for it. I on the other hand with a very average 3.0 GPA have a limited amount of choices.
- Did my undergrad and PhD in neuroscience, doing a postdoc.

I'm going to start of by saying that I love my job.  Many people hate this position, especially after so many years of work and studying and shit pay and huge amounts of uncertainty, but you really have to know what you're getting out of this and why you're going into this field before jumping in completely, as well as weight out the risks.  You need to be a bit naive, a bit hardened, a bit crazy, and a bit entrepreneurial if you're deciding to go into this direction. 

Part of the difficulty with a bio degree is that nobody tells you the options from the start.  Unlike business, which pretty much as things lined up for you and tells you what metrics need to be hit in terms of internships and such, biology sort of gives you this huge course load that makes you *think* that's the most important part, but in fact you need to be gaining independent experience while doing the coursework.

The reality is that a biology degree alone doesn't get you very far, and you definitely do need to go into a Masters program at the least to get some of the better lined up jobs.  Toxicology, pharmacology, and public health are amongst the better and more practical choices for programs to pursue if you're interested in getting a better paying job.  You mentioned bioinformatics, which is probably the thing *in highest demand*.

Higher degrees than that are nursing, med school, and pharm school.  The latter two are expensive, and jobs for pharmacists are starting to dry up, so that could be some difficulty.  

Then there's the PhD route.  I've seen people go into this for all the wrong reasons, including: 1) not having gotten into med school, 2) the prestige (there is none, I can attest), 3) it's the next logical thing to do, 4) it'll get you an even higher paying job.  The problem is that, even if you were to land a well-paying job with the PhD in industry (which still requires usually a 2-4 year postdoc of some sort), you would make less lifetime earnings than doing a Masters.  If you don't need it, don't do it.  If you want a reason for going down this route, ask and I'll tell in another post, because it's a bit more involved as to why I personally think it's worth doing, but what type of person you sort of need to be to really get into it and take a huge jump into a really scary field.

What if you've graduated and now are in need to figure out what to do?  If you're not settled on a graduate program of some sort, best to find laboratory experience somewhere for a few years and then make the next decision.  Others have chimed in some decisions.

So what about those business school guys?  This one's a bit tougher to convince otherwise, but I've seen it happen to most of my friends that majored in "business."  Let's preface this by saying that most people I knew in college or had gone to school for one thing or another usually didn't end up doing the thing they studied for in college.  The exception to this rule has been anyone doing a PhD or med degree.

Of all the business school friends, all but one still works in "business" per se.  Most got great paying jobs straight out of college, but all of them hated it so much that they left within two years and went onto other ventures (teaching, for instance).  The ones that have stuck around aren't happy being in business; they make a significant amount of money, but they aren't particularly happy people or satisfied with their work.

But this has been true for many people I know.  Most people who were engineering students no longer do engineering-based work currently (some went into business).  Those in business often did something else entirely new.  Those in music and history are doing something entirely different.

But of the people doing biology, oftentimes they do *some work in some aspect within the biological field*.  That can mean sales, setting up meetings, lobbying, or whatnot.  It's an obviously important field (it's the study of life for fuck's sakes, and everyone's living it), but it's also (very much currently) underfunded.

Lesson is, don't be concerned about the extrinsic rewards others get for their work.  Most won't stay and most won't be happy with those choices.  It's up to you, though, to figure out what you want, how you want to integrate your studies into that future, and how determined you are to want that.  Don't lose hope; just plan a bit ahead of what needs to be done.
- What do you have for work experience and where are you located? Are you willing to move and or travel? Just a few things to consider. 

I've always felt that the most important thing you should take away from college (aside from the education, maybe) is an ability to network. I hate it. I don't like schmoozing. I feel awkward putting myself out there. But you have to do it, especially if you want to work in industry. Academic labs are always hiring low paying jobs for people with no experience, and you should certainly keep that in mind as a fall back, but if you want something that pays decently for someone with just a BS or MS industry is where you want to be. 

Anyways, once you've built up a network you'll end up in a position where someone you know, somewhere, knows someone who can put you in touch with someone who is hiring. I went to a school that requires work experience/internships as part of the program and as much as it sucks now paying the loans for that, I wouldn't have gotten my job without knowing the hiring manager from a previous company (and my wife wouldn't have her job if my boss didn't know her boss).  Building this kind of network takes time. It may be worth considering a job with low pay but good growth potential if it gets you experience and gets your foot in the door. 

Also, on the pay front, as much as it sucks to say, if you wanted to make big money you chose the wrong field. Sure, a PhD in industry may be pulling a few hundred k a year or more if highly experienced, but they tend to be the outliers. If you get lucky you'll find a company with a good stock plan that can pad your wallet a bit, but $40K starting with a BS is pretty average.
- If you can find an area that you really like and apply yourself to it for grad school and beyond, you may be able to make something of it. Granted, you'll be inside academia for forever and never make a grand living, but you've gotta draw a line somewhere and decide if a career in research biology is really worth it. Me, I love research and want to stay here as long as I can. Am I marketable to many other job fields? Hell no. But I know the majority of those jobs wouldn't fit who I am. 

     Yeah? Your business friends just got a job making 80k a year? At least I get to go outside and enjoy myself the way I want to. Biology ain't easy, but that's part of what makes enjoyable.
- I graduated in 2009 in Molecular Biotechnology and I'm in the same boat as everyone else. I'm still making just over $15 an hour and can't get any interviews. First job was data entry for a clinical pathology lab. Worked my way into lab aide for the cytogenetics dept  and was about to move into the new molecular dept, but had to move, so I'm back at square one. From that, I learned your best bet is to fight upstream from the bottom. But don't try that with the military because they'll choose veterans over civilians for open positions even if you're more qualified.  Also, if you go into clinical work, get a certification (from ASCP for instance) since it weighs much more important than a college degree - go figure. Get a cert for tech or "scientist" and you can get work at any hospital's lab.

Good luck, don't give up, and I hope you'll do better than I did.
- Look into the medical field, there are many options. your school should be able to assist you / provide more information.
- I struggled for a couple of years doing shit-tier lab tech jobs at companies that I'm sure were skirting FDA regulations, but it all paid off when I landed my current job at a Fortune 500 pharma. Just hang in there and keep applying to everything. Even a shit job will get you a little bit of experience that can take you places.
- I graduated in May with a double major in Biology and Environmental Science.  I'm currently making $10.50 an hour as an MRI tech aide.  There are a lot of places you can go if you further your education by a year or two, but it caps out around $40/hr once you've been doing the jobs for a really long time.  But you will need to further your education, and then you'll make around $20/hr.  At least in my area.  All those certificate programs pay off but it takes a couple years.  If you want more money, apply to work in different fields or pursue a master's in another field.
- meta: What the, this thread is really really bleak looking.
- This is why I went to a community college to get my biology associates before deciding if this is the field I actually want to be part of. It wasn't, I graduated though with a 3.78 gpa, new friends, and about $1000 spent on my total tuition costs. I was angry that my parents forced me to go to a community college rather than a 4 year school, but couldn't thank them more at this point, I couldn't imagine being 50k-100k in debt right now with a degree I don't care for.
- Go to grad school, a lot of earth science programs could use someone with a biology background.  You could get into paleontology, biogeochemistry, marine sciences, etc.
