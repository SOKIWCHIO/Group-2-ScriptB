Title: Hair Cortisol

Content:
Hi all! I am a graduate student learning how to process hair cortisol in my PIâ€™s wet lab. Iâ€™m having issues because the hair is very staticky. I have to cut 3cm, cut the hair with scissors into tiny pieces, then using tweezers I put them in a 2mL cryovial with ball bearings. After this the hair is ground in a machine. I canâ€™t get the hair to stop sticking to everything and right now it takes me 30 minutes per 1 sample to try and get as much hair into the vial as possible. If anyone works with hair, I could really use some tips on how to prevent this.

Comments:
- Can you dip hair samples in liquid nitrogen?  I was assigned to isolate dna from Ixodes.  It took close to an hour to squish it in alcohol ðŸ˜’. Dipped in N-took 30secondsðŸ¥³. Hair will break easier for those tiny tubes as well-only question is affect on your hormone? Cell samples are routinely deep frozen so Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s ok.

Low tech-wipe with dryer sheet butâ€¦chemicalsâ€¦or use cold, humid hair by holding in refrigerator for an hour in damp cellulose towels.  Orâ€¦try keeping samples in those electronic static free bags before prep ðŸ¤”. That taps my creatively for tonight!  Canâ€™t wait to see the results-very interesting.
- These are great! Thank you so much. Iâ€™m guessing Nitrogen would be okay. After the samples are ground, we add methanol and that gets dried out with Nitrogen.
