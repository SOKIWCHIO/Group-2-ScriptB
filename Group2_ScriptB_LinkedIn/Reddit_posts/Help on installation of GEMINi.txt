Title: Help on installation of GEMINi

Content:
Hi there,
I am trying to install GEMINI for genetic variation on my local machine but even after multiple attempt to solve it I am unable resolve it. Dow anyone have any idea?

it initially says:
The environment is inconsistent, please check the package plan carefully
The following packages are causing the inconsistency:
/
  - conda-forge/noarch::flask==2.3.2=pyhd8ed1ab_0

  - conda-forge/noarch::ipython==8.14.0=pyh41d4057_0

  - conda-forge/linux-64::scikit-image==0.20.0=py310h9b08913_1

 and give a long list after that gets stuck on

failed with initial frozen solve. Retrying with flexible solve.
Solving environment: failed with repodata from current_repodata.json, will retry with next repodata source.
Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done

and ends with some error

Comments:
- Jus use conda?

https://anaconda.org/bioconda/gemini
- GEMINI might not be compatible with the tools you already have installed in your current conda env. Probably you should try making a new env and installing the GEMINI in there. See [https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for details on creating envs and installing tools in them
- What's your error? We'll need more information to help at all.
- Thank you for reply. I have done this, but the error still persists. I have updated my post with more details please give it a look.
- Thank you. I have tried that too but still error continued.
- Thank you for your reply. I have uploaded the post with more details about error please give it a look.
- Looks like they’ve broken the install at some point. If you check the GitHub for Gemini it recommends you replace it with slivar https://github.com/brentp/slivar

Don’t know if it will do what you needed Gemini for though. I largely work with bacteria and sys admin stuff lol
- As another user mentioned, creating a new conda env is likely a workaround, however have you tried other stack overflow answers like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55527354/the-environment-is-inconsistent-please-check-the-package-plan-carefully)?
- Thank you so much. I am new to this I will try to work around with slivar and hopefully everything goes perfectly.
