Title: Help with ML Algorithm

Content:
I have a simulated dataset containing a distribution of variables with underlying number of clusters, means of each cluster and number of data points in each cluster known. I would like to train my algorithm on this simulated data and then run on real data. What kind of supervised machine learning approach should I use?

Comments:
- I mean, if you have the means of each cluster, aren't you just doing K means? 

Otherwise, post a snippet of your data and it might be clearer what you want
