Title: Help with ML Project for Damage Detection

Content:
Hey guys,

I am currently working on creating a project that detects damage/dents on construction machinery(excavator,cement mixer etc.) rental and a machine learning model is used after the machine is returned to the rental company to detect damages and 'penalise the renters' accordingly. It is expected that we have the image of the machines pre-rental so there is a comparison we can look at as a benchmark

What would you all suggest to do for this? Which models should i train/finetune? What data should i collect? Any other suggestion?

  
If youll have any follow up questions , please ask ahead.
