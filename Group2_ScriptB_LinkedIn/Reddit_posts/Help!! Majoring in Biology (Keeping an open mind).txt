Title: Help!! Majoring in Biology (Keeping an open mind)

Content:
Hello,

I am new to Reddit and have a situation that I am running into with my life. I started school late because I took care of my father who was bed bound and did not have time and when I started a local community college I was not have the proper knowledge because I have a learning disabilities that restricted me in my earlier years of K-12 and had to work my way up to college level. Those LD's are Dyslexia and Dyscalculia. But because of all my circumstances I will be transferring to a California State University or University of California (Preferably a UC). I also was a part time student because I still took care of my father until just recently on his passing. I will be transferring when I am 25 or 26 and be getting my BS around 28 or 29 and I feel that is a bit old because I want to do research.

When I first started college I was majoring in Computer Information Science and had to fill in a biology requirement and decided to take Introduction to Evolution. I was sold there and decided that I will take another course in biology and ended up taking an Ecology class and was one of the most enjoyable classes I took and then took a interesting approach to Animal Behavior in an evolutionary perspective. By then I decided to commit to majoring in Biology. When I took those classes I found that I was interested in Evolution (Mainly human evolution) and microorganisms, but I am keeping my mind open to other avenues of biology just because  it is big field of study and so many paths can be taken. I also would like to throw in there I am also thinking about majoring in Biological Anthropology just because I love human evolution and studying about hominids. Also, I am volunteering at a biotech lab getting experience at my school making agar gel and testing PCR machines with some other factors. I going for a general biology degree that will focus on something that will decided later on be chosen and at this point I think I would like to work in research at a medical lab and  eventually become a professor at a four year university (I like the structure at academia).

At this point I am getting a little bit discouraged because I will be at my school for a long time and would not like to flip burgers and don't want o be that 30 year old grad student. My goal would be to obtain a Phd but I want to focus on the now then the future. I would like to know what field might suit me best or some field I should consider, and will list what my interest are below. If you can give some insight or advice I would be grateful. I am sharing things with the internet that is not necessary but I feel that it helps paint an image for you so for that I ask for some logical and respectful responses. 

Interests:
Biology; Evolution, Human Evolution, Primates, DNA, Microorganisms (Microbiology?)

Considering: Biological Sciences: Molecular and Cellular Biology.

- First, don't worry about your age, you're only a few years older than the other students and younger than I was when I went back to school. You're never too old to pursue your interests and research/academia is a life-long endeavor. You'll have plenty of time to catch up. 

As far as what field might interest you, since you have a CIS background have you considered any informatics fields? I would think something like phyloinformatics would be of interest to you given your interest in evolution. I had the opportunity to work on a project that required sequencing and phylotyping bacteria, but I've also seen research sequencing different species to create phylogenetic trees. 
I would suggest keeping an open mind while you complete your BS requirements. Get into a lab at your school as early as you can, try a few different things out, and be sure to read lots of relevant journals.
- Microbiology has applications in environmental remediation. A big one that is emerging is treating mining waste, as it is relevant to maintaining safe, clean natural drinking water sources.
- So uh, I'm a 30 year old graduate student. Most graduate students I know in Biology are 30ish. So don't think there's some sort of age limit on schooling.
- I wouldn't let your age hold you back on what you want to do. At the end of the day, it'll be what you do for the rest of your life so why not make sure it is something you love? Sure you might be a bit older than other students, but you have the advantage of maturity, better work ethic, and a higher degree of interest (a lot of young students just want to party/are at post-secondary because of their parents).
  
You still have some time, so experiment a bit and see what you like best. Volunteer in labs with different professors to see if their field interests you. I know for a lot of professors, if you tell them you want experience with lab work and original research, they look to pair you up with a Master's/PhD student to help them on their project (so you are actually learning and doing something meaningful). It also has the benefit of giving you an idea of what a grad degree entails. Also, look to see if your school does summer research awards or anything like that. NSERC funds a lot of summer Undergraduate Research Assistantships (one based on academics, other is based on financial need) which again gives you a nice bit of experience and is also payed work.
  
Other than that, if you are thinking about doing a PhD, then work towards it as if that is what you are doing. Even if you change your mind later on, it's better to have the grades/experience incase you ever change your mind. I wouldn't let it be too daunting though. It is always possible to jump right from your BSc to PhD; all you need are the grades and a supervisor willing to take you on (both are pretty easy, still a lot of work). At the very least, it prepares you better than the majority of the people getting Master's, and you save yourself 2 years of schooling. I am doing this jump right now, and it is so satisfying. Not only do you get to do a lot of cool stuff, but it really prepares you for any kind of position afterwards whether it is academic or in the private sector.
  
I am pretty biased towards graduate programs and whatnot, but if you have any other questions, let me know! At the end of the day though, you have to do you. What ever makes you happiest and floats your boat, go for it. I would say at this point you deserve it!
- Don't be discouraged. I returned to school at 35 to persue my degree, I am currently a bio major at a private university. I will be somewhere between 38 and 42 when i finish depending on how far i go. I too suffer from multiple learning disabilities and have found that if you are open and upfront with the school upon entering there are many programs to assist you in your progress through the courses. If you have any specific questions about stuff please feel free to pm me
- My professor was telling me to look into either environmental science or bioinformatics (which I am assuming is similar to what you are talking about). I still like CSIS and the programming side of things but would like to work in a lab then a cubical.  But sound interesting and will check it out. Thank you
- My professor advice's me to look into environmental science because I had a knack for his ecology class and did good in his labs. But would that be under environmental microbiology what you are talking about? Sound interesting and if it involves lab work I will be happy.
- You'd still have plenty of bench work to do, so don't worry about that. We easily had a few hundred hours worth of lab work to process samples (mostly DNA isolation and PCR).
