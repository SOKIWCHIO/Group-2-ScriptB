Title: Heterogeneous gene expression

Content:
Hi, i am hoping i am asking this in the right place

i am trying to understand a paper that is talking about machine learning model to identify gene interactions

I  have been trying to understand what is the meaning of heterogeneous  gene expression and why if a gene expression data set is heterogenic  then Gene-Gene Interaction does not depend on the correlation factor   that much.

This is the link of the paper. Thanks

And  please if you can point me some resources or books that i can  understand the concepts that would be tremendously appreciated .
