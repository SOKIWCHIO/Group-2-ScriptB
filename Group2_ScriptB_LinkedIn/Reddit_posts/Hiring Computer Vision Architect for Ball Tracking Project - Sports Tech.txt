Comments:
- And the estimated project budget is?
- Dm’ed you
- Is this a full time position?
- I would love to be involved in this project somehow. I'm currently working on a similar project doing event tine prediction based on game film. 

I don't have a background directly in computer vision as most of my work has been based in deep learning and time series, though
- Look at this user's post history.
