Title: How can I learn to classify diabetic retinopathy from fundus images?

Content:
Hi everyone,

I'm a web developer with experience in building applications using JavaScript frameworks and automations using Python. I’m currently working at a hospital and my goal is to build a system that can classify the levels or type of diabetic retinopathy using eye fundus images.

I’m new to the world of machine learning and computer vision, so I’d love some advice on how to get started and how to structure my learning path.

Thanks in advance!

- That’s like the lowest effort post we have in this sub. „Hey people, I have not done the barest minimum of research and I want to do this super cool thing. How do I do that?“. Honestly, go read some fundamentals, do some tutorials and come back with specific questions.
- You need a labeled dataset with enough samples( maybe thousands)

You can either train from scratch or try to finetune another pretrainet network, it’s not an easy task and there is no single way to approach it
- Have you checked the messidor dataset? I have done some work in this direction and published a paper on diabetic retinopathy detection using deep learning as well.
- There was kaggle challenge on this task, I remember participating in it like 7 years ago. Go find it
- Use any classification.
- Also, is OP hoping to release a medical product? Or to have a bit of fun?

Medical ML is hard to do for a good set of reasons, data privacy, and proving the effictiveness of the results are two key issues.

I worked for a company making novel key hole camera systems, and they were trying to AVOID using ML/AI to make it easier to get the product through regulators.
