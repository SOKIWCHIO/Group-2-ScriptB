Title: How do Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) detect features in images? 🧐

Content:
Ever wondered **how CNNs extract patterns from images?** 🤔

CNNs **don't "see" images like humans do**, but instead, they **analyze pixels using filters** to detect **edges, textures, and shapes**.

🔍 In my latest article, I break down:  
✅ The **math** behind convolution operations  
✅ The role of **filters, stride, and padding**  
✅ **Feature maps** and their impact on AI models  
✅ **Python & TensorFlow code** for hands-on experiments

If you're into **Machine Learning, AI, or Computer Vision**, check it out here:

Let's discuss! What’s your favorite CNN application? 🚀

Comments:
- Yet another CNN article?
- Rather basic image processing to cnn..should be explained in detail.
- But this one’s AI generated!
