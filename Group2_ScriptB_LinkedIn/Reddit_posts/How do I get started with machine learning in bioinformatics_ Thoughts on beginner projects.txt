Title: How do I get started with machine learning in bioinformatics? Thoughts on beginner projects

Content:
Hi,

I am a bioinformatics PhD student mostly working with omics data. (RNA seq mostly)

I have some experience with machine learning through a previous thesis project but I wanted to get started with working on application of machine learning using different kinds of omics data.

What would some beginner and intermediate level projects to get started?

&#x200B;

Thank you everyone for thoughts and suggestions.

Comments:
- You can try building some HMMs for some type of genomic features. That would be a good beginner entry point.
- You can also try to predict protein family from rna, using supervised learning techniques, and labelling a dataset of sequences with their protein family. It could be interesting!!
- I thought the replies by u/o-rka on another thread may be helpful:

- Google has a great free ML course online. This is an ideal place to start. Or your university probably has an intro to ML course in the comp sci dept.

- Do you have any tutorials and/or packages that you recommend? Is Scikit-learn a good software to start with?

- Find a paper that includes their dataset in the supplemental data, maybe even their code, and try to recreate it with the same or a different dataset
