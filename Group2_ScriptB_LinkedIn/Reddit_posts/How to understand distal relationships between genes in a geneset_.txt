Title: How to understand distal relationships between genes in a geneset?

Content:
I have a geneset I use as training data in machine learning (rows of genes by columns of their annotations). The genes have been curated as they're disease-causing genes.

However, I want to understand the genomic relationships between my training genes, to see if there's any underlying bias in my training data before I show my trained model new data. Particularly I'm looking to check if my training genes are close to each other in the genome. (If I have a lot of training genes in close genomic distance to each other, they're more likely to have similar annotations and therefore the model will be biased to a particular trend for predicting a gene group, if that makes sense).

So far I've been seeing how many genes are on each chromosome, just simply counting the number of genes per chromosome. However, I know some chromosomes are bigger than others or have more genes and I want to account for that in my analysis.

I'm not sure how/which statistical test I can use to check this - I have a biology background, and minimal stats knowledge. I've been looking into using a likelihood ratio test, but I can't see how I would apply it in R to my data.  


My data looks like:

|Chromosome|Total protein-coding genes (in ensembl)|Protein-coding genes training group 1|Protein-coding genes training group 2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2063|5|15|
|2|1292|4|4|
|3|1076|6|3|
|...|...|...|...|

On googling I can't find any previous research looking to test if a dataset is biased towards having genes on certain chromosomes, or a test indicating whether genes have a distal relationship to each other - does something like this exist? Sorry if maybe this is more of a stats than a bioinformatics question and thank you for any help!

Comments:
- How exactly did you get this list? That can change a lot of the context to the question.
  
You could try http://3dgenome.fsm.northwestern.edu/view.php which is a database showing linked expression between inquiry genes and other regions of the chromosome it is thought to interact with.
  
I would also challenge you to consider what ways that information can help; it is certainly interesting, however, if you change your gene list too much then you might be biasing the model on selective input.
- couldnt you just do a histogram/KDE curve of start loci and a histogram/KDE curve of end loci (or just middle loci if you dont care about potential length biases) for the gene set and see if any bins are over represented
