Title: Humble Bundle: ML, GenAI and more from O'Reilly

Content:
This 'pay what you want' [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/machine-learning-ai-and-bots-oreilly-2025-books) from O'Reilly is very GenAI leaning

Comments:
- Really nice bundle!
- There's some decent stuff in there like the Chip Huyen book and AurÃ©lien Geron one. I am a bit bewildered that O'Reilly published two separate books on prompt engineering though.
- Thanks
- You know youâ€™re a student when 25$ for 17 full books still feels like a wallet stretch ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
- Awesome, thanks for sharing!
- Just bought it, thank you so much!
- So great, thanks !
- It's not an official site?
- thanks!
- I thought so too. usually the bundles are older material, but these are pretty current
- Google "libgen" and get all the books ðŸ˜‰
- I think that's the default, but you can get it for $1
- Aren't the PDFs available throughout the internet?
- The minimum price is $25 to get all 17 books.
- Yes
- Aahhhh, I see, thanks. Apologies, I feel like I remember being able to pay less for previous bundles Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
