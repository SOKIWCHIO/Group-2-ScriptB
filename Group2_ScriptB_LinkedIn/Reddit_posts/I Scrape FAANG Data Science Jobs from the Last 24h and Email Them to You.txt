Title: I Scrape FAANG Data Science Jobs from the Last 24h and Email Them to You

Content:
I built a tool that scrapes fresh data science, machine learning, and data engineering roles from FAANG and other top tech companies’ official career pages — no LinkedIn noise or recruiter spam — and emails them straight to you.

What it does:

* Scrapes jobs directly from sites like Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Stripe, Uber, TikTok, Airbnb, and more
* Sends daily emails with newly scraped jobs
* Helps you find openings faster – before they hit job boards
* Lets you select different countries like USA, Canada, India, European countries, and more

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions!

- Good project!
- Cool tool! If you ever need to scrape LinkedIn job postings at scale, theboomerang.co's ExportLinkedInJobs service ($5.5/1k rows) could be a helpful backup.
- This is really cool!! Thanks!
