Title: I need a help

Content:
Hello everybody, I'm new here at this sub, I'm Junior student at computer science and I have been accepted in a scholarship for machine learning. I have a graduation project to graduate, our project is about Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles, our group are from 4 and we have 3 months to finish it.

so what we need to study in CV to finish the project I know it's a complicated track and unfortunately we don't have time we need to start from now

Note: me and my friends are new in ai we just started machine learning for 2 months

Comments:
- Would you mind sharing more details, please?

Would you be allowed to use a neural network for object detection (MachineLearning, DeepLearning, NOT ComputerVision), or it HAS to be ComputerVision and ComputerVision only?
- Dude, I would just use YOLO (yeah, I know), I have a post about it where I used YOLO to beat fruit ninja, it's a good post/video to have a good idea on how to do it, but if you have more specific questions let me know
- Fork this: [https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/blob/main/docs/notebooks/use-cases/object-detection-in-videos.ipynb](https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/blob/main/docs/notebooks/use-cases/object-detection-in-videos.ipynb) that should help you get started and understand video/frame inferences/bounding boxes etc..
