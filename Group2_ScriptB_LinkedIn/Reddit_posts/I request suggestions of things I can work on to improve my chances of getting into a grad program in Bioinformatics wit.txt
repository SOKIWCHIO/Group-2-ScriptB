Title: I request suggestions of things I can work on to improve my chances of getting into a grad program in Bioinformatics with an EE undergrad. Link to objective inside

Content:
Hello, I am an Electrical Engineering undergrad. I have some experience in Data Analysis, Data Science, Python, statistics, machine learning, but I am not a CS student. Unfortunately I know very little of biology.

I'd like to get this kind of job at Sanofi: [mRNA Machine Learning Principal Scientist](https://www.pdfhost.net/index.php?Action=DownloadFile&id=592b311dd1f6ae6272adbdc23d180806) (if you don't want to click, I will post the important bits in a comment below).

I will need a PhD. What can I do while I am still in undergrad university to increase my chances of getting there, with my not ideal background? If it's impossible, let me know. Thanks :)

>S/he will have deep knowledge and experience in both RNA Biology/ Biophysics/ Biochemistry and bioinformatics/ data science/ machine learning. S/he will be responsible for designing, prototyping, and validating computational solutions to diverse scientific challenges in the fields of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. S/he will have a high degree of proficiency in Python/R, machine learning and deep learning libraries, bioinformatics tools and cloud computing.

>Employs machine learning methods such as deep learning, neural networks, reinforcement learning, graphical and generative models to deconvolve high dimensional experimental and in silico modeling results
- Can you do a bioinformatics final year project, or an MSc?  I think you'd get into a PhD from EE anyway, computational skills are transferable
- I have seen a few bioinformatics msc courses that assume no knowledge of biology. All they ask for is some mathematical/stats knowledge only. No chance of entry into a phd, but doing a msc first is definitely possible from a non-biology background
- My idea is to go for grad school in Europe, and they mostly require a MSc before the PhD. My doubts is whether I can get into this MSc with the very poor biology knowledge that I have.

Yeah I want to do a final year project in something Bioinformatics but I don't even know where to start honestly. What could I even do?

By the way, do you know any EE in this field?
- My idea is to do this in Europe, so a MSc will be required anyway. However I have heard that europeans tend to be less flexible with people of different backgrounds coming in.
- Send some cold emails to the biology/CS department at your uni, an yea maybe robotic stuff but I'm not the best person to ask.  Engineers enjoy a lot of success in Synbio if that helps
- Synbio is about 'automatizing' biologial experiments, right? I have heard of it
- nah its about applying engineering principles to biology, it just happens to involve automatisation for some things a lot :P
