Title: Indian Sign Language Model: Feedback Wanted

Content:
Hi everyone,

My friend and I are working on a machine learning project focused on recognizing Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures using deep learning. We’re seeking feedback and suggestions from computer vision experts to help improve our approach and results.

# Project Overview

Our goal is to develop a robust model for recognizing ISL gestures. We’ve used a 50-word subset of the INCLUDE dataset, which is a video dataset. Each word has an average of 21 videos, and we performed an 80:20 train-test split.

# Dataset Preprocessing

1. **Video to Frames:** We created a custom dataset loader to extract frames from videos.
2. **Landmark Extraction:** Frames were passed through Mediapipe to extract body pose and hand landmarks.
3. **Handling Missing Data:** Linear interpolation was applied to handle missing landmark points in frames.
4. **Data Augmentation:**
   * **Random Horizontal Flip:** Applied with a 30% probability.

# Model Training and Results

We trained two models on the preprocessed dataset:

1. **ResNet18 + GRU:** Achieved 88.74% test accuracy with a test loss of 0.2813.
2. **r3d18:** Achieved 89.18% test accuracy with a test loss of 0.7433.

# Challenges Faced

We experimented with additional augmentations like random rotations (-7.5° to 7.5°) and random cropping, but these significantly reduced test accuracy for both models.

# What We’re Looking For

We’d appreciate feedback on:

1. **Model Architectures:** Suggestions for improving performance or alternative architectures to try.
2. **Augmentation Techniques:** Guidance on augmentations that could help improve model robustness.
3. **Overfitting Mitigation:** Strategies to prevent overfitting while maintaining high test accuracy.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Are we missing any key metrics or evaluations to validate our models better?

Thank you for your time and insights. We’re eager to hear your suggestions to take our project to the next level!

Comments:
- Assuming you haven't used these, here are my thoughts.  
**Here are few things to try to prevent overfitting:**  
\* Early Stopping : stop training once the validation performance reaches a certain level.  
\* Dropout : Regularly drop connections in your model to prevent over-reliance on specific neurons.  
\* Batch Normalization : Improve convergence and reduce overfitting by normalizing activations.  
\* Cross-Validation : Validate your model on different subsets of the data to ensure robustness.

**Some of the evaluation metrics apart from accuracy:**  
\* Precision  
\* Recall  
\* F1-score  
\* AUC-ROC  
\* Confusion matrix  
If your models are used for regression (predicting continuous values like timestamps, video ratings etc.), use these metrics :  
\* MAE (mean absolute error)  
\* MSE (mean squared error)  
\* RMSE (root MSE)  
\* R-squared (coefficient of determination)
