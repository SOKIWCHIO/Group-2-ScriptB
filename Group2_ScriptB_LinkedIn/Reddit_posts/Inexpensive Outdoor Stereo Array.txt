Title: Inexpensive Outdoor Stereo Array

Content:
I'm working on an outdoor agricultural project on the side to learn more about CV. I started the project with a cheap rolling shutter stereo camera from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805541822136.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.4.337b1802xZn7S5&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa). I was having issues with stuttering etc. when the vehicle the camera is moving, especially when it hits a bump. This is causing issues with my NN which is detecting fruit and go/no-go zones for motion.

I moved on and purchased a [global shutter stereo camera](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256809197339653.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.59.56f6ewkSewkS8c&algo_pvid=a6bbf9e4-9725-48ad-a638-63df2a9570a8&algo_exp_id=a6bbf9e4-9725-48ad-a638-63df2a9570a8-58&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%22-1%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=6%40dis%21USD%21131.45%21113.05%21%21%21131.45%21113.05%21%40210308a417561420413948607eaf49%2112000048940073120%21sea%21US%21732383337%21X%211%210%21n_tag%3A-29919%3Bd%3A1fd82372%3Bm03_new_user%3A-29895&curPageLogUid=PDXRFuWSDWIE&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A%7Cx_object_id%3A1005009383654405%7C_p_origin_prod%3A) from a company named ELP. Testing indoors indicated this camera would be a better fit for my use case, however when I moved testing out doors I discovered the auto-exposure is absolute garbage. I'm having to tune the exposure/gain manually which I won't be able to do when the machine is fully autonomous. 

I'm at a point where I'm not sure what to do and would like to hear recommendations from the community.

1. Does anyone have a recommendation for a similarly priced stereo pair that they have used successfully outdoors? I'm especially interested in depth and RGB data.

2. Does anyone have a recommendation for a similarly priced pair of individual cameras, which can be synchronized, that have been used successfully outdoors? 

3. Should I build my own auto-exposure algorithm? 

4. Do I just need to bite the bullet and spend more money?

Thanks in advance.

- What distance range do you need?

Look for color “machine vision” cameras. Put a color target similar to a Macbeth color checker in view of the cameras for continuous adjustment.

Color adjustment, white balance, and similar algorithms aren’t as easy to implement robustly as they first appear.

To reduce blur due to bumps, you’ll need to reduce the exposure time of an image capture. That can necessitate the use of an external light of an appropriate color temperature.

In general, I’d suggest trying to create fewer elements of your system at first. Put a camera on a tripod and work on the image processing. Try that under a variety of conditions. Then incrementally add one feature or component after the next. 

Rather than implement autonomous motion or path planning at the beginning, walk around with the camera in hand. Then you can quickly test different conditions: shaking, moving between rows of vegetables, etc.
- One could alleviate the issue by using a gyro (IMU) to detect bumps and just skip the frames during the most aggressive ones. Or they could cherry pick frames where minimum camera rotation is detected.
- Yeah I'm pretty sure I'll have to go that way. Or Orbbec.
- Fantastic ideas, thanks!
