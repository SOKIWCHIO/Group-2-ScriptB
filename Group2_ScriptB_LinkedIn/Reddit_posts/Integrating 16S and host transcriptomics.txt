Title: Integrating 16S and host transcriptomics

Content:
Hi all! I'm working with paired 16S rRNA sequencing and host transcriptomic (RNA-seq) datasets, and I'm interested in integrating the two to explore host–microbiome interactions. I want to apply AI/ML approaches to this integration, but I’m still navigating the best strategies and tools for doing so.

I know there are some existing studies in the human microbiome space that tackle this kind of multi-omics integration, but they either don’t quite align with my setup or are difficult to replicate from a methods standpoint.

If anyone has recommendations for tools, packages, or papers they’ve found helpful for microbiome–host transcriptome integration, especially those incorporating machine learning, I’d really appreciate it!

TIA! :)

- Hmm I feel like the request is a lil broad here. Could you please clarify the biological question? sample type?
- Want to integrate AI? Plop this bad boy into chatgpt and it’ll tell you exactly what you want to hear.
