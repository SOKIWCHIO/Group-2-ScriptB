BRUH - But…!!

Comments:
- Looked really weird until the PHD. I guess that’s a thing people can do
- Well, it's 4 years later, how did things turn out?  I guess they went into industry?

Edit: Yep, finance.  Not surprised.
- Me with <3 GPA, that too from a low tier college and no work experience. 

I'm never making it out of the hood with this one.
- Intern is just a job model for students, not level nor payment defining. Going through a serious academic life while working is hard. Especially for phd, advisors usually prefer the student 100% focused in the research, since working can cause poorer performance.

This one is surely better than a ton of mid level devs
- This isn't that unheard of for PhD students.
- This person seems like they found their passion.

That amount of internships is kind of crazy but my bet is they’ll go academia with this level of obsession.
- Wish I could have had the opportunity to intern during my PhD. Instead I wasted a lot of valuable time on dead end projects. The interning model of higher education is a great idea
- that phd is worth a lot right now tbh
- I've done 2x summer internships during my PhD, and ended up working during the year at both. About to start a third. They pay a lot for one, like 1 month is nearly my entire yearly stipend. Professors hate you though.
- Don't let your asian parents see this.
- Nobody has that much free time during the PhD. I'd like to meet this person. Perhaps it's a research thing where he/she collaborated with these companies and listed that as an internship experience.

- What's the point of having a master's degree in data science when you already have a 4 year bachelor's in data science? At MIT no less. Just go industry or phd
- It’s really cool that they got all these high value internships. Not going to lie though, doing a PhD over the course of 5 years after having a finished masters is kind of long.

- Internship merchant
- We're cooked
- 3 majors and a minor at MIT in 3 years. Either they have the gene mutation where they don’t sleep or this is fake.

- Profile Link pls: I need book him/her for this road map!!!
