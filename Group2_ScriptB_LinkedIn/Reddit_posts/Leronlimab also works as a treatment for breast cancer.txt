Title: Leronlimab also works as a treatment for breast cancer

Content:
Hi Folks, I am excited to share my latest video with you!

This is a summary of the paper: Antibody-based CCR5 blockade protects Macaques from mucosal SHIV transmission.

It outlines the anti-metastatic effect that leronlimab, a humanized monoclonal human CCR5 antibody, exhibits against human breast cancer in a mouse model. These data indicate that leronlimab reduces breast cancer metastasis and that it can be used in conjunction with current chemotherapeutics. 

Any thoughts on the video are greatly appreciated. I hope that you enjoy learning about this interesting topic! 

This is a video from my YouTube series summarizing scientific papers. These are meant to be easier to digest for non-specialist audiences to help make primary scientific articles more accessible to everyone.
