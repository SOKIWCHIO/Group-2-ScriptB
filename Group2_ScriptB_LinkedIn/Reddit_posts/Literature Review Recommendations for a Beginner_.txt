Title: Literature Review Recommendations for a Beginner?

Content:
Hi all. I'm heading to university this fall and will be starting at a lab which uses microscopy and machine learning to study bacteria. The goal is to better understand structure of biofilm and the regulation of different biomolecules & signaling networks in order to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

For my own leisure and to better prepare for the lab, what are some interesting literature reviews or publications I should read besides that of the lab? 

Also, my interest in biology are as follow:

* biochemistry
* biophysics
* molecular biology
* computational biology 
* bioinformatics
* stem cells
* bacteria (antibiotic-resistant bacteria)
* cell membrane

Thanks!

Comments:
- lehninger's principle of biochem for biochem
molecular biology of cell for mol bio
essential cell bio by alberts for cell membrane
and brocks biology of microorganism should cover the bacteria
- Know about PubMed, the search engine that focuses on bio-med?

You can limit output to reviews. And can sort by date, to see most recent.

I am inclined to suggest focus on the lab papers, at least to start. That will lead you to related papers -- both as general background and related work.

You can also generate ideas you want to look up.
