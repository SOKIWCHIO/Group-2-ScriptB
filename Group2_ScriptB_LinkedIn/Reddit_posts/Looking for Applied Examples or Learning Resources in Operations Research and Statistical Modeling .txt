Title: Looking for Applied Examples or Learning Resources in Operations Research and Statistical Modeling 

Content:
Hi all, 

I'm a working data scientist and I want to study Operations Research and Statistical Modeling, with a focus on chemical manufacturing. 

Iâ€™m looking for learning resources that include applied examples as part of the learning path. Alternatively, a simple, beginner-friendly use case (with a solution pathway) would work as well - I can always pick up the theory on my own (in fact, most of what I found was theory without any practice examples - or several months long courses with way too many other topics included).

I'm limited in the time I can spend, so each topic should fit into a half-day (max. 1 day) of learning. The goal here is not to become an expert but to get a foundational skill-level where I can confidently find and conduct use cases without too much external handholding. Upskilling for the future senior title, basically. ðŸ˜„

Topics are:

 - Linear Programming (LP): e.g. Resource allocation, cost minimization.

 - Integer Programming (IP): e.g. Scheduling, batch production.

- Bayesian Statistics
    
- Monte Carlo Simulation: e.g. Risk and uncertainty analysis.
    
- Stochastic Optimization: Decision-making under uncertainty.
    
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): Sequential decision-making (e.g., maintenance strategies).

- Time Series Analysis: e.g. forecasting demand for chemical products.

- Game Theory: e.g. Pricing strategies, competitive dynamics.

Examples or datasets related to chemical production or operations are a plus, but not strictly necessary.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Comments:
- I had time to do some more research and came up with a first draft for my learning path. I'm sharing it in case it is of use to someone else:

- Linear Programming (LP): e.g. Resource allocation, cost minimization. (13 h)

- Integer Programming (IP): e.g. Scheduling, batch production. (12 h)

- I can recommend two books I learned a lot from.  These are specifically for OR and business & supply chain applications of statistics and optimization.

\- Operations Research: An Introduction - Hamdy Taha - Great overview of LP, MIP, and applications

\- Operations Management for Competitive Advantage - Chase, Jacobs, Acquilano - Higher level MBA-type text, but the best and most mathematical of its type

For forecasting, the best text is "FPP2" by Hyndman.  It's free online.  Beware - I've seen a lot of people at my company waste their time with advanced forecasting.  There must be something about forecasting that some people can't resist.  In my experience, an auto-exponential smoothing model is good enough and anything more is like committing hundreds of hours to a 1% improvement.  This opinion is specific to monthly time series.

I'm not aware of any Bayesian statistics textbooks that are specific to chemical industry or manufacturing.  That may be a little too specific.

I also recommend you don't spend too much time on Wikipedia or free pdfs online.  I've found that they're a poor substitute for a good textbook.
- Ohh... It's helping me too
- Might want to look at udemy or coursera for OR courses.  Can also look at MIT Open courseware
- Following
- It will help many, thanks for sharing
- Thanks for sharing!
- Nice
- I see you've posted a GitHub link to a Jupyter Notebook! GitHub doesn't 
render large Jupyter Notebooks, so just in case, here is an 
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) link to the notebook:

Want to run the code yourself? Here is a [binder](https://mybinder.org/)

- That's really helpful advice, thank you.


I think I'll look into the Taha book. That seems like a great fit. Maybe I'll put the forecasting on a lower priority, too. That usually is limited by fragmented, siloed and low-quality data anyhow. After I'm done with cleaning, I'm usually not so eager for forecasts anymore, anyhow. ðŸ˜„



Thanks again. ðŸ™‚
- Thanks for the idea. 
I already had had a look at Coursera and didn't find anything that aligned with my requirements. Udemy does have more granular courses but the ones I found weren't of particularly good quality - or lacking on exercises. But thanks, I'm generally fond of udemy, just forgot to check them, too.

I have started piecing separate materials together. ðŸ™‚
- You're welcome! Hope it's useful.
- I don't think you will find all those in just one course.  It is 1-2 years of undergrad that would actually cover a lot of those courses.  

Might also want to take a look at a number of OR textbooks
- That's fair, thanks.


After doing some more research, I realised how specialised my situation might be. I found a number of resources, I'll post them in a separate comment.
