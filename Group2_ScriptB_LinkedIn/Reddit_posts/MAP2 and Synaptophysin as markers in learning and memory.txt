Title: MAP2 and Synaptophysin as markers in learning and memory

Content:
Hi--my lab does a lot of westerns looking at MAP2 and synaptophysin in terms of markers for LTP and neuronal plasticity associated with learning and memory--but the more I read, I see that there are major disagreements over MAP2. Coupled with the issue of different phosphorylation states (too many to count) being implicated in different processes/functions, I'm a little lost.

Does anyone know a good antibody or two to get started--I'm interested in doing some immunoprecipitations. 

Comments:
- Usually authors will state where they got their antibodies in the materials and methods section
- The main issue is that there doesn't seem to be a consensus in the literature--I'm reading and trying to get a good idea of where to go--I wanted to see if anyone had any personal experience in their research.
- I mean--I need something that can help me determine the phosphorylation state of MAP2, not just the expression of it.
