Title: ML model metrics for genomic divergence 

Content:
I am building a machine learning model for calculating genomic divergence in butterflies  and itâ€™s a Bayesian logistic regression and the thing is I only have 8 butterflies genomes but the data is really good to train my model and so the main metrics I will be using is dXY, FST, dN/dS ratio, are there any metrics that would be nice to add to my model ?
