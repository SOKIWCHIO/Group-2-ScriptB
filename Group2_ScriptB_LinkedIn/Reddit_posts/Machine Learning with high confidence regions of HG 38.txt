Title: Machine Learning with high confidence regions of HG 38

Content:
Hello dear bioinformaticions! 

I want to do some ML for a project of mine. The input for my model are one hot encoded DNA sequences which I will then use  to predict some stuff. 

My problem is now, that Neural Networks can be quite quirky to train if the data is too noisy. I am not sure which parts of the HG38 Genome I should kick and which to keep. BTW I have to use HG38 since the data i want to predict is hg38 based. 

I know that there should some tracks around to mask regions of low confidence but am not completely sure what to take. I was thinking to kick telomere and highly repetitive regions. But there are probably others too. Any recomendations on that? 

Maybe there is some kind of high confididence annotation for the hg38? 

Thanks in advance!!

Comments:
- Search for project encode black list, it has regions of high noise or repetitive elements.
- Take a look at the Genome In A Bottle consortiums recent publications. They have a BED file of the high confidence regions they used for benchmarking variant calling tools.
- Could you train on CHM13 v2.0, then use a liftover to convert coordinates to/from hg38 where necessary?

- Thanks, I'll have a look!
- Thank you very much! That sounds really convenient!
