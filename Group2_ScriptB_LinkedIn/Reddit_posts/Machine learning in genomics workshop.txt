Title: Machine learning in genomics workshop

Content:
Hi all,
Please summer is coming, what are some workshops or conferences you are attending to improve your machine learning in Bioinformatics skills.?

I’m specifically interested in machine learning for genomics, I’ll appreciate your recommendations.

Thanks.

Comments:
- The Canadian Bioinformatics Workshop series hosts an online Machine Learning workshop this year from [August 16 to August 17](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops-all/2023-machine-learning/)
- [Illiniois' AIFarms](https://aifarms.illinois.edu/) gets into this.
- Hey, that's us! Thanks for recommending. 

FYI, CBW may have "Canadian" in the name but we have international participants in every workshop. Happy to answer any questions!
- Thank you
- I have only heard good things about the CBW courses and I know many of the faculty members. I can't recommend them enough!
