Title: Machine learning on omics data online course

Content:
I would like to find an online course that covers machine learning approaches (random forest, NLP, MLP, deep learning etc.), and best practices on biological (preferably omics) data. I searched through Coursera, but I just couldn’t find the right one for me. Do you have any suggestions?

Comments:
- [Omicslogic](https://learn.omicslogic.com/) has a bunch of very nice courses on analyizing biological omics data
- Manolis Kellis has some course lectures on YouTube that look good.
- Thanks everyone!
- Theres one by yash gupta on udemy you can try. Also the AWS machine learning courses and subsequent certification cover many aspects with the majority focused on modelling/explanation of various algorithms and use cases for them (which surprised me since i assumed it would all be focused on AWS services).
- How much are you willing to pay for such a course?
- There are many institutes that provide really good courses. So, I think it will be better if you look for options too. I’ll share the list of other institutes with you,  
1. NIIT  
2. COURSERA  
3. UpGrad  
4. EdX  
5. Udemy
- they have a bundle of great courses!, but do you know free courses?
- $3.50
- Well, the company I work for covers it, so up to 50-100$ per month
