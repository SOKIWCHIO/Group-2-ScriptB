Title: Master in bioinformatics or data science ?

Content:
Dear community, 
I am working with python the last 1 year and I am currently learning keras and tensor flow. I would like to find a job that combines machine learning and biology. One of the main reasons is my expertise, I have a PhD in biotechnology and experience in fields like immunology,  genetics, molecular biology. I was thinking that for computational biology jobs you need at least a masters degree.  However I see in LinkedIn jobs more positions for data science. I was wondering whether it is better to do a master in bioinformatics or data science? Can a master in data science  help you to pursue a career in computational biology? Thank you.

Comments:
- With a PhD you have proven to be more than efficient in self-learning. So another master title would be useless. Just try to find a position where you can learn computational methods and spend a lot of time learning by yourself.
- I know someone who got a well-paying data science job in health care with just a natural science ph.d. and practical knowledge of the basic data science languages... That's what you should do rather than take on more debt and waste time.
