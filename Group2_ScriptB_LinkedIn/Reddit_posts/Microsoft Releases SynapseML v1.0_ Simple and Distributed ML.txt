Title: Microsoft Releases SynapseML v1.0: Simple and Distributed ML

Content:
Today Microsoft announced the release and general availability of SynapseML v1.0 following seven years of continuous development. SynapseML is an open-source library that aims to streamline the development of massively scalable machine learning pipelines. It unifies several existing ML Frameworks and new Microsoft algorithms in a single, scalable API that is usable across Python, R, Scala, and Java. SynapseML is usable from any Apache Spark platform (or even your laptop) and is now generally available with enterprise support on Microsoft Fabric.
