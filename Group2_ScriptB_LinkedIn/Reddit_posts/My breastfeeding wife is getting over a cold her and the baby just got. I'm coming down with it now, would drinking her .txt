Title: My breastfeeding wife is getting over a cold her and the baby just got. I'm coming down with it now, would drinking her breast milk help me get over it faster?

Content:
Since it's my wife, I'm not really concerned about disease transmission provided it's freshly pumped and consumed.  

Would viral antibodies actually be transmitted this way?

Thoughts? Concerns?

Edit:

Ok I've decided to try a 30mL challenge of breast milk from my wife who recently recovered from what we believe is the same cold.  The progression will be documented below, I will try not to deviate from my usual cold management protocol of hot showers, tea, fluids, electrolytes and alternating between light to moderate activity and naps with a blanket on the couch.  

**-12hours**: in retrospect I may have had some prodromal symptoms such as sneezing more frequently.  (Initial exposure believed to be from drool-and-snot-covered baby fingers inserted directly into my nose and mouth, several times over the previous 72 hours, despite my best efforts)

**0 hours:** Initial symptoms were a "dry" feeling throat, and a bit of fatigue.  Upon inspection in a mirror, there was obvious swelling and redness in the lymphatic tissues in the throat, consistent with viral infections I've had in the past.  

**+3hrs:** I made this post.

**+12 hours**: I woke up with a definitively sore throat.  In terms of colds, I've learned to gauge them based on the initial symptoms and other's experiences.  I would give this one a 5/10.   Not the worst, but not super mild.

**+15 hours**: I've had some tea for a pick me up.  Drinking water and tea has improved throat soreness somewhat, probably since it was dry upon waking up.  My nose is starting to run, but the sinus tissues are not inflamed enough to make me feel "stuffed up".  Not much sneezing reflex, but I occasionally feel the urge to blow my nose.  No fever, but feel less tolerant of cold. **I've taken 30mL of fresh breast milk from my recently recovered wife.** It tastes a bit like heavy cream that's been watered down.  ...Like a weird mix of full fat and watered down.  Slightly sweet aftertase.  There's some flavor notes I have no precedent for so I'm unable to describe them, but they're subtle.  Also, for the record, this was not consumed straight from the teat.  She extracted the milk using " the haka" (named like the Maori intimidation/welcoming dance), and I drank it from a glass.

**+21 hours**: Alright. At the moment, I actually feel pretty good! My sinuses are not too inflamed, my nose is clear.  It is running a little, but less than it was when I first woke up.  I think I've sneezed twice today.  The sore throat has definitely improved.  So far this is not super atypical for a cold progression.  Normally I would expect to wake up tomorrow feeling worse, and I'd expect it to have moved into my sinuses to the point where they become inflamed enough to no longer be clear.  I am clearing my throat, so its possible that I may be developing a cough.  We'll see.  I'm planning on re-dosing another 30mL breastmilk tomorrow morning if I'm not feeling well.  I'd call symptoms a 3/10 right now.

**36 hours**  Holy shit guys! Symptoms are about 1/10.  I feel nearly fine.  I can breathe through my nose.  I woke up and blew my nose, and what came out was mucus as it has begun to thicken, like on the last days of a cold.  No drippyness, and no feeling of inflamed and pissed off sinuses.  I have a slight remaining scratchiness in my vocal chords & occasional desire to clear my throat.  I am not completely free of symptoms, but they are so mild, this is great.  This will likely be the quickest resolution to a cold I've ever had.

Comments:
- This is the best question I have ever read.
- No it won't help. Your body will produce antibodies way faster just by being sick than by you drinking milk containing antibodies.
- Whatever you do, ask your wife before drinking that liquid gold. An angry breastfeeding wife who’s short milk will kill you a lot faster than a cold.
- I don't think it will entirely help, since it's meant for babies who don't have a good immune system yet. Your natural antibodies will work faster and more efficiently than what the milk will provide. 

So are you just gonna... Suck it out like a baby? Your wife will let you do that? Kinda... Weird. But hey, it's up to you and her.
- Her milk would likely have antibodies to the virus. It wouldn’t hurt to drink her milk. Not sure if it will help or not.
- Nope, and if your baby is over ~6months it wouldn't help them either. Once you have an immune system the Ab in breastmilk aren't useful anymore.
- This is r/biology not Ask.com
- Interestingly enough, it is currently my most controversial post ever.  I don't really get it, its a serious question about something with a potentially plausible mechanism.

For the record, its about 3 hours post 30mL dose and... I actually feel pretty good.
- Not if antigen specific immunoglobin is present in her milk because of the recent infection though. That would take a few days of misery for me to develop, right?

It's just been a long time since I had my head wrapped around any real immune physiology so I thought I'd ask here.  My Google fu on the subject takes me to sources that are either too low level to answer the question, or so high level as to be too specific.
- Not to worry, this would be consensual milk-drinking.  I'd want to get it fresh off the pump to preserve the maximum amount of that possiblly beneficial immunoglobin.
- Straight from the source baby! That's how we roll.
- My review of the literature suggests that infants continue to receive enhanced immune protection from breastfeeding up to 1 year of life.

...she has a pump and another device for extracting the milk, so no need to make it weirder than it has be, but I appreciate your inquiry.
- I'm thinking I might try a 30mL challenge and see if my condition improves.

- Admittedly, my immunology classes are a long way away also and we certainly never studied this particular scenario. But as I understand, antibodies alone are not a cure for viral infections. It requires your own cells to recognize the pathogen.   The antibodies are a tool used by your cells to attack the infected cells. They are necessary but not sufficient. Your body is already producing its own set aid antibodies along with all the leucocytes. It don't think it would be able to use the foreign antibodies to accelerate the process.
- Breastmilk contains IgAs, they act differently than IgG. At 6-8months infants will start producing their own IgG, the IgGs they had prior are "delivered" during fetal development from the mother.

Antibody administration is i.v. not oral for a reason.
