Title: Need Advice and Resources for Interview Preparation: Research Position in Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Content:
Hi everyone!

I’m a sophomore in college preparing for an interview for a research position in **machine learning** and **deep learning** with a focus on **artificial societies**. I’ll be working with a team mostly composed of PhD and Master’s students in computer science, so I’d love to come as prepared as possible.

**A bit about my background:**

* **Project experience**: Voice gender classification, UNET-based image segmentation for lunar crater detection, and Traveling Salesman Problem (using Simulated Annealing).
* **Research interests**: Primarily in deep learning and computer vision applications.

I’d appreciate any advice or resources! Specifically, I’m looking for:

1. **Interview tips**: What should I focus on for research-oriented ML roles, especially when working with advanced researchers?
2. **Key concepts**: Are there technical/theoretical ML or deep learning topics that are especially important for a research setting?
3. **Recommended resources**: Any must-read papers, books, or courses to help me prepare?

Thanks so much for any advice or insights you can share!
