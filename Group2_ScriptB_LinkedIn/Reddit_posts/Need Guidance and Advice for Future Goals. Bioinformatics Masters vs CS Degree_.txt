Title: Need Guidance and Advice for Future Goals. Bioinformatics Masters vs CS Degree?

Content:
Hello everyone,


I graduated with a degree in molecular biology but I found that I did not enjoy the experience of working in a wet lab. Now, I'm left feeling uncertain about the specific direction I should take my career. I was hoping I could share some information about me to get your thoughts on the matter and to get some advice on achieving some of my goals.


First of all, I want to say that although I did not enjoy the wet lab aspects of my biology education, I still like learning about the theoretical/molecular parts of biology. I also took an intro to bioinformatics course in my last year. The course was structured where we would have lectures focused on the more theoretical aspects of bioinformatics, such as going over some basic alignment algorithms. I found this part of the course to be really dry and uninteresting but that could be because of the professor or because there weren't really any practical demonstrations/any code to mess with. The majority of the course consisted of labs where we would learn python and how to employ it for biological applications. I found that I really enjoyed programming. Since graduation, I've learned a little bit of R and have messed around with some differential gene expression analysis tools like DESeq2. I think the aspects of programming that I've enjoyed the most so far are problem solving (it feels amazing to get something to function after being stuck on it for so long), the feeling of satisfaction that you've created something, and going through large datasets to find useful inferences.


So, I think I've come the conclusion that I enjoy programming and that I enjoy the theoretical aspects of biology. So, naturally, I should start applying to bioinformatics masters (which I have.) The problem is that bioinformatics is such a vague term and I'm really not sure what specific area of bioinformatics I should focus on. I'm primarily focused on getting a job in industry over academia (I've heard a lot of horror stories about how academia can be) unless I can find a really good job offer in an academic setting. Are there specific areas of bioinformatics that are really sought after in industry?


Another thing is that I would like to become much more proficient in programming. I value the flexibility that it will offer me in finding jobs outside of biology. So, I'm concerned that getting a masters in bioinformatics will not give me enough knowledge/experience in programming. As an alternative, I've started looking into some of the computer science masters offered by universities in the UK. These are 1 year conversion masters of which I've heard mixed things about. Apparently, these masters are not always looked that fondly by employers. Recently, I've also found out about post-bacc degrees, which are usually around 2 years and you get a BS.c in computer science after completion. I'm still in the process of researching these offerings but it seems like a better approach than the 1 year conversion masters. If I do go with the computer science degree route, what aspects in bioinformatics will I miss out on? I'm guessing I will miss out on a lot of statistics, which I'm concerned about. I got pretty good marks in my stats courses but I never felt like I internalized what I learned, so I'd appreciate learning more about it.


Lastly, I think I'd like to gain experience developing and using machine learning and AI tools. I know these have become big buzz words but I'm genuinely interested in learning about it and maybe applying what I learn to some hobbies I have. It seems like the post-bacc degrees that I've looked at don't offer any courses centered around this. It is offered by some of the masters that I have applied to for bioinformatics but only at the intro level, so there's still going to have to be a lot of self study on my part. I think I'd prefer self studying to get into this domain anyways because my math foundation is pretty bad and I've had some bad anxiety related to math. Now that I've graduated though and there aren't any grades on the line and because I can see the practical applications for it, I think I'm much more motivated to learn the subject. Will there be anything that I learn in a CS degree that would make me better at understanding concepts for machine learning?


I'm sorry for the long post and if it appears that I'm rambling at times. I just want to provide as much information as I can to start focusing in on what I should do in the future. Please let me know what your thoughts are and thank you for the help!

Comments:
- I would have to more or less agree with u/Nice_Slice_3815. Part of the reason why I only did a cs minor is because I did not want to deal with the lower level languages and computer architectures. I will disagree though that data strucutres and algorthims aren't relevant to bioinforamtics. Bioinformatics algorithms is an active part of bioinformatics and algorthims have changed how biology is viewed today and algorthims are kinda everywhere in bioinformatics. 

&#x200B;

You don't really learn how to program at most cs degrees. It may vary though but most programs are very therotical and pretty math heavy. They teach you the theory and you're mostly expected to learn programming on your own. You will program however I argue that its not the main focus of a cs degree and a cs degree doesn't make you a better programmer.
- Hey I’m a computer science(data analytics to be specific major) I honestly think if your interested in bioinformatics it would be better to just take the master in that specifically, I feel like if you take a CS major your gonna learn a whole lot of shit particular at lower level languages..i.e data structures and algorithm complexity, which you may not even need in field for bioinformatics, also you may not even touch on machine learning unless you specifically take a course on it anyways. I know that CS majors in my school do not require machine learning courses to graduate and their only required for those specialization in data analytics(my major).I honestly think imo the best way to learn machine learning is to teach it to yourselve… find a topic your interesting in then get a dataset off of a website like kaggle and practice fixing machine learning models to it, there plenty of machine learning rescourses on YouTube and chatgpt can help you get started with implementing code if you know to ask it the right things. For example, I have a disease called psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis so I took a dataset off kaggle and programmed a classification algorithm to differentiate psoriasis from other skin diseases. There’s also plenty of other bioinformatic datasets like mri images you could use machine learning to detect cancer in image data.

And tbh the masters will always look way better on paper when applying for jobs, you can learn the CS and prove that you have the knowledge by working on a git repository without having to take a CS specific major. The biology part may be harder to prove without the piece of paper.

I’m just a data analytics student who as an interest in getting into bioinformatics as well so I don’t really have any in field experience so take my opinion with a grain of salt.
- Oddly enough I have recently walked through this decision process with a young adult in my life.  She applied to both Masters in Bioinformatics and CS Masters - but bridge ones where you spend a year doing undergrad prerequisite and if you do well enough you are pre-approved for automatic entry into the regular CS Masters.  She got accepted into more than one of each.  In the end she went with a bridge program to CS Masters. It will take an extra 9 months or so but the one she choose was a US Ivy League school. So even though she will spend an extra $40 to $50K in tuition and take an extra year the prestige of the university combined with flexibility of CS made the difference in going the CS route.  But honestly as I read your comment it seems like you are more directly interested in the biology and genetics than she was.  With a stronger passion in that direction Bioinformatics might be the right path for you.
- TLDR: CS is not for learning programming, but rather CS theory. Good bioinformatics degrees should offer a reasonable balance between practical and theoretical CS. 

I think if you are doing more computational work in the bioinformatics degree, you will still be able to learn programming. CS degrees are normally not where you learn more programming but you learn more about computer science theories (at least the good ones). In my undergrad degree for example, I only have 2 CS classes learning about programming, one in Java (to learn about OOP) and another in C. Other more useful languages such as Python and C++ (not C with classes) are assumed to be languages that you know yourself, or ones you should be able to pick up quickly. I would argue that good bioinformatics degrees will also have computer science theory classes relevant to bioinformatics rather than general CS. For example, a lot of degrees that I found have algorithms in bioinformatics as part of the course, which would focus on algorithms that are applicable to bioinformatics (e.g., in bioinformatics you may not need to know about NP completeness for example, but you definitely will need to learn string algorithms). ML/DL is also a pretty big field which you can go very in-depth in terms of mathematical theory, but that is most likely not necessary if you just want to apply it to gene clustering for example. And if you want to learn things such as software development, most likely academia is not the right place to search for such experiences.
- Thank you for the help. In my research, I've also come across others saying that a CS degree involves less programming than one would think. I have heard though that the way of thinking and the theory that you learn as part of a CS degree does make you a better programmer.


So far, it seems like the post-bacc degrees are like a CS degree but with most of the fluff removed. They are usually completed in 2 years (I could link the core courses of one of these programs if you'd like.) Most of them only have one math course centered on discrete math.

Out of curiosity, are there any areas of bioinformatics where lower level languages and computer architecture are useful? I'm not well versed in these areas of CS, although computer architecture sounds pretty interesting to me. I'd imagine having knowledge in these areas would be useful to develop efficient bioinformatics software but I could be completely wrong.
- Thank you for you opinion! I haven't heard of data analytics before is that similar to a data science degree?


I forgot to mention this in my original post but I think I may want to transition to the software development side of bioinformatics, so the CS stuff will still be useful. I think I need more experience with CS before I make that decision though. Depending on the area of bioinformatics, algorithms are really useful for things like sequence alignments.


You're right that none of the CS post-bacc programs I looked at so far have offered courses in machine learning. I was just hoping that maybe the concepts and way of thinking you learn in a CS degree would be transferable/helpful in a machine learning concept (since machine learning is usually a CS/stats centered field from what I've seen.) I'm going to try to learn machine learning by myself thank you for the advice about using kaggle, I'll look into it.


I think having a degree in molecular biology already proves that I know the biology part. The trouble now is showing that I know the stats/CS part. Taking into account your advice, I think the main thing I'd be concerned about if I go with a bioinformatics masters and self learn CS and machine learning is that I may end up trying to self learn too much and end up accomplishing nothing due to the lack of structured learning.
- Thank you for your input and congratulations to her! I do have an interest in biology but I think I may value the flexibility that comes with the CS degree more. This is still something I'm mulling over though. I think part of the reason I'm a little hesitant to commit to bioinformatics is because it's such a broad field but still niche in terms of employers and so I'm not sure how an industry job will look like. I may not be able to find a job in the field of bioinformatics that I end up liking.
- Thank you for assuaging my uncertainty about a bioinformatics degree not containing enough CS theory. That does make me a lot more confident in committing to the degree.


You mentioned that academia is not the right place to learn about software development, where would you recommend to learn it instead? I've heard a lot of mixed things about bootcamps (especially about the statistics being manipulated by bootcamps to make them seem like a more successful option than they actually are.) Even if they were very successful, I'm not sure if that would be the right option for me. I think I'd like to cover myself and learn some software development/engineering so I have some flexibility when entering the job market because I feel uncertain about how the bioinformatics job space looks.
- CU Boulder’s post-bacc program does have an ML class, as well as data science, and AI.
- If you want to learn software engineering, best place is of course being able to practice it in industry. It is only in industry that you will be able to learn more about producing production worthy code, testing extensively as much as necessary, and other CI/CD pipelines stuff. Unfortunately, right now the software industry is such that you need prior experience to get new experience. Some easier ways to get experience would be to do SDE projects in your own time, or possibly get a position (paid or not) in a startup/connections. You may also be able to gain SDE experience in a uni if you are already in a student, since those are typically easier. Rn the market for software engineering is pretty tough, but if you are not an international you should still be able to apply to plenty of companies. I’m an international in the US rn so it’s pretty tough for me, so I’ve been volunteering in a group to make websites for nonprofits, which was a valuable experience insofar as it made me realise that I really do not like SDE.
- Thanks for the info! I had a feeling that experience would be really important and since my primary goal is a job in industry I made sure that most of the masters programs that I applied to had an internship as part of the curriculum. I haven't found any CS degrees that have an internship as a part of their curriculum yet. Unfortunately, I'm from Canada so I'm an international but some of the masters that I have applied to are in the US and hopefully I'll be able to make good connections from the internships there, if that's the route I decide to take.


May I ask why you didn't like SDE and what you're switching to instead? You'll never really know if you'll enjoy something until you take the plunge and try it. That's basically why I'm trying to be as flexible as possible and explore my interests in bioinformatics, CS, SDE, ML, so that I can get a better understanding of what I like and don't like
- I just never really found learning the next web framework or software framework interesting. I also wasn’t much interested in building projects that were just pure full stack development. I had like 3 experiences so far, and I didn’t enjoy any of them. On the other hand, I had a lot more interest in digging deeper into machine learning research, taking extra math and statistics courses that aren’t often required as part of a CS undergrad degree in the US. My current interest is in the use of ML/DL for protein structure prediction, so I’m doing research in a related lab rn. I hope to pursue grad school research in the use of ML for drug design in the future, though I don’t really have the relevant biochem courses to back me up so I may need to transition from a more computing heavy area. I would say that if you are exploring SDE, you may also want to look into embedded systems programming. I found that learning and programming lower level systems are more interesting to me than developing websites and software.
- Good luck on on your research and your future pursuits! I'm glad you've found an area that you're interested in. I haven't looked too much into it yet but stuff like alphafold does look really interesting. If you don't mind, could you tell me what areas of machine learning, math, and statistics you're learning for protein structure prediction? I'd like to know which areas I should focus on since I think I'll end up largely self-teaching myself.


I will look into embedded systems programming, thank you! I will say that while I don't mind developing software, I have 0 interest in developing websites.


I thought that taking a CS degree would provide me with the most amount of flexibility but after talking with you, I'm starting to side more with taking the bioinformatics masters for flexibility.
- I’m still not really experienced in using ML for protein structure prediction, so I will just list out some subjects that are pretty useful for understanding what ML algorithms aim to do: calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistical inference, ordinary differential equations, and vector analysis. If I have the time I may also take some differential geometry since recent research in ML has touched on using some concepts in that. I think the problem I have right now is that I may not have as strong of a biochem background, which means that while I understand papers when they are discussing ML methodologies, I may not understand terminology such as protein folding, or the inner intricacies of how to transform protein data effectively so that the machine can truly learn useful things from it. 

I think if you have a molecular biology background, you do not necessarily need to have a bioinformatics degree and can choose to pursue CS. However, just know that a CS degree doesn’t really teach you software development. At least in my school, the degree was very useful in teaching you the foundations and computational theory, but may not be as effective in teaching software dev frameworks. If you want to work at a generic tech company, a CS degree may offer more flexibility since those companies don’t necessarily know what bioinfo is. However, if you are going for software dev roles in more bio-related companies,  a bioinfo degree in which you took on heavy computational work is probably going to offer the same advantages. It’s really up to the quality comparison between the programs.
