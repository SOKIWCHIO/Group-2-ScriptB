Title: Need Guidance: Embedded Systems in India & Abroad – Job Market, Pay & Future

Content:
Hey everyone,

I’m an ECE student exploring a career in **Embedded Systems**. I’ve been hearing mixed things about the field, especially in India. Some say the job market here is already **saturated and low-paying**, which makes me a bit worried about long-term growth.

I did some online research and found that adding **TinyML (Machine Learning on Microcontrollers) and Edge AI** to embedded systems is being considered the *future of this field*. Apparently, companies are moving toward smarter, AI-enabled embedded devices, so it seems like the career path could shift in that direction.

I’d love to get input from people already working in the industry (both in India and abroad):

* How is the **embedded systems job market** right now in India vs other countries?
* Is it true that salaries in India are **quite low compared to the difficulty of the work**?
* Do skills like **TinyML and Edge AI** really open better opportunities?
* What’s the **future scope** of embedded systems if I commit to it for the next 5–10 years?
* Would it be smarter to build my career in India first or try to move abroad early on?

Any personal experiences, advice, or even roadmap suggestions would mean a lot 🙏
