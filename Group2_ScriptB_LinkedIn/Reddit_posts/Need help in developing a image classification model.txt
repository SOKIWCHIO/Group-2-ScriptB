Title: Need help in developing a image classification model

Content:
Hello everyone!

I’m currently working with a dataset of two different bee species, trying to build a machine learning model that can differentiate between them based on their wing venation patterns (landmarks). But I’m facing a challenge: the venation patterns are very similar, and despite properly annotating the images, the model is not able to distinguish between the species. 

I’m new to this image classification domain.
I would appreciate any suggestions or assistance on how to improve the model's performance. Thank you!
