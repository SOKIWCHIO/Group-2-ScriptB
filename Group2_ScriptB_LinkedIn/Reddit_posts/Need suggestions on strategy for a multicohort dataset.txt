Title: Need suggestions on strategy for a multicohort dataset

Content:
Hi, so im working on a 18 cohort metaphlan4 profiles and metadata for all cohorts. Looking to create a statistical machine learning model for CLR normalised data. Long term plan was to use either lasso or random forest but before i get to that point what else should i look at or get done.

Any suggestions and advice is much appreciated
