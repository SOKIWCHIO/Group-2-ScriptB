Title: New job opportunities is sports analytics! Including Junior positions

Content:
 

Hey guys,

I'm constantly checking for jobs in the sports and gaming analytics industry. I've [posted recently in this community](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1b8xr3y/zelus_analytics_and_tennessee_titans_are_hiring/) and had some good comments.

The job board updates daily and as we know, the market is not as dynamic as before so I wanted to share several data science positions that appeared recently.

There are multiple more jobs related to data science, engineering and analytics in the job board.

I've created also a [reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/sports_jobs/) where I post recurrently the openings if that's easier to check for you.

Disclaimer: I run the job board.

I hope this helps someone!
