Title: Online MS in Machine Learning?

Content:
Hey everyone!

My work has given us the clear to have some amount of tuition reimbursed for continuing education. I currently have an MS in Statistics, but it's largely focused on traditional statistics with a bit of ML. I think it makes sense to pursue an MS in ML to further my understanding, but since I'm employed full-time, in-person classes are not an option. Does the community have an opinions on which programs may be more or less worth looking into for a respectable credential and a strong learning experience?

Comments:
- Georgia Tech's online Ms in computer science with a machine learning specialization is pretty well respected.  Their CS program is ranked 8th in the country, yet the degree is only $6,600.  I am starting this program next spring.

UT Austin just recently started an online MS in Artificial Intelligence for $10,000, which you may be interested in also. Coincidentally, UT Austin was tied with Georgia Tech for their 8th place ranking among computer science programs in the US.

While there are other good CS programs out there, these are the schools that are high quality and still allow you to take mostly ML courses.
- Look into GaTech OMSCS or OMSA programs that will cost you <$10K
- I think the component you're missing is Computer Science.
- Id you do not want to lose time for application prep you can directly start University of Colorado Boulder's Online MSDS.
- Georgia tech has a good course
- Is it possible
- Woah, that Ms in Comp Sci seems pretty good for the price. Might have to take that one on
- What about in Europe, Germany ?
- I feel GT OMSA maybe redundant. OMSCS may be a better route with their ML specialization.

UT Austin is another great choice!

I'd also look into Upenns master in data science program too
- Can you expand upon that for me?
- What's the cost and how well does it look on a resume?
- OMSA would definitely be redundant for someone who has an MS in statistics. I would say that UPenn's Masters in data science might be redundant too, because there's so much overlap for stats. 

My personal opinion is that a masters in data science is a solid degree for someone who doesn't have a degree in computer science or statistics already, especially not a master's in statistics. You learn just enough stats and just enough CS to do the job, but you're not necessarily an SME in either field.

I got a masters in data science 2 years ago and it allowed me to transition from a data analyst position to a data scientist position, so it was quite valuable for me. However, now in my career I realize I want to go even deeper into the cs/ml aspects of the field so I'm starting in the omscs program.
- 15.5K. The degree is as normal as the on-campus one
- How far into the OMCS program are you?

Thank you for sharing your ideas - I didn't think about CS as a route in ML.
- I start next January.
