Title: PCR research suggestions

Content:
Hi all, 

I was recently given access to a laboratory with PCR, DNA extraction, electrophoresis gels, uv-spectrophotometer, and microbial culture kits. I have little experience in PCR and gels but I am learning. The laboratory manager no longer works at the college so I'm more or less on my own. 

My background is marine toxicology and chemistry.  I'm on a small island in the Pacific and was hoping to do some research using the above equipment on waterborne fauna specifically bacteria. (but other ideas are definitely appreciated!!)

Can anyone offer some brief research project ideas I could use to get started? I do not have access to a sequencing machine but I may be able to send off samples to be sequenced. 

Thanks!

- Knowing what to do is the hardest part of science. 

The best way to think of something is to read papers.
- Whereabouts in the Pacific are you if you don't mind me asking?
