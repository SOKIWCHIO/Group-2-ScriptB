Title: Paper with code is completely down

Content:
Paper with Code was being spammed (https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lkedb8/d\_paperswithcode\_has\_been\_compromised/) before, and now it is completely down. It was also down a coupld times before, but seems like this time it has lasted for days. (https://github.com/paperswithcode/paperswithcode-data/issues)



Comments:
- It was working for me yesterday, but was down for a few days for me before that.
