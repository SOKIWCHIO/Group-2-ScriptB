Title: Position-Specific Scoring Matrix 

Content:
Hello, I have a physics and machine learning background so not super familiar with bioinformatics. I am doing a protein secondary-structure prediction project and I would like to get the **PSSM** out of some aminoacid sequences of proteins.

  
I read that this can be achieved using **PSI-BLAST**, however I have no idea how to if anyone can send me a tutorial or has any hints or advice it would be very useful.

**Thank you all**
