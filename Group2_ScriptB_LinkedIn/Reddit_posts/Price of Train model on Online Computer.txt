Title: Price of Train model on Online Computer

Content:
Hello Everyone,

Someone has paid for Train model on Online Device. Like a U-net model or other deep architecture ? 

because of buy a machine for a Deep learning project is too expensive, and I like an experience return on this type of train.

Can you give your experience, the price and time of your computation, and the online computing device.



Thanks a lot

- Depends on your various factors like model, dataset size, GPU type, number of epochs, and batch size, I trained a YOLOv8 model on a 50k-image dataset with a batch size of 32 on a GCP A100 GPU for about 100 epochs, which cost me approximately $24.
- You can pay for colab pro for a month for $10. Training with the free version can be difficult but you could also try that first.
- It's going to be a few dollars to several hundred. All depends on whether or not you get the results you want at the first trial.
- Anywhere from $0 to $10,000+ USD. 

If I had to pick a number I’ll go with $100. I say this because you must be a beginner and will probably use a platform that gives you a nice easy interface which doesn’t require a lot of coding - these aren’t always free. I also assume that if someone is paying then this is going to be used commercially which means you will be doing enough training that free options are too limited. 

If you can write the code and know your way around the CLI and cloud platforms then you can do with less cost.
- Thank you for your feedback. it's very interesting. what's the computing time of your train ?
- Thank you for your tips, I don't know it's adapted for a deep architecture like GAN, or Deep CNN. But you're right I can try that first, and add computation after :)
- Yeah, idk the cost computation of model. It's for a future research
- What cloud platforms do you recommend?
- Around 11-12 hours
- You can try your model on colab first then estimate how many hours/minutes you gonna need. Because most of the services charge only for training minutes not for how long you spend uploading and tuning your code.
- Whichever one your employer already works with. 

I use Azure and it’s fine. I try to do as much as I can on premises though just because I can avoid the paperwork associated with getting permission to expend cloud resources.
