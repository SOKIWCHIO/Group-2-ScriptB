Title: QUADRA is out!! - Opensource library to train and deploy DL models

Content:
**QUADRA is out!! 🎉🎉🎉** 

QUADRA is an **opensource library to train and deploy DL models** in a very simple and flexible way and to compare, monitor, and share experiments quickly!

🌐 Website: [https://orobix.github.io/quadra/](https://orobix.github.io/quadra/) 📁 GitHub: [https://github.com/orobix/quadra](https://github.com/orobix/quadra) 

QUADRA development started to answer the necessity to **perform machine learning experiments for multiple customers and projects**, without the need of a large copy-pasted codebase over multiple repository.

**Are you a data scientist or an AI researcher?** 

With QUADRA you can: → simplify your deep learning experimenting process; → train and deploy deep learning models in a simple and flexible way, using YAML configuration files and open-source tools such as Hydra, Lightning framework, and Pytorch; → compose your experiment configurations from single command line interface, so you can conduct multiple experiments with different settings and hyperparameters; → compare, monitor, and share your experiments quickly!
