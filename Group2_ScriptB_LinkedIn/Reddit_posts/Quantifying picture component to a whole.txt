Title: Quantifying picture component to a whole

Content:
Simple example would be chopping a square into 4, with 1 image representing each quadrant. Overlaying these 4 would each get a score of 0.25 to get back to the original picture. 
Or we need 0.5 mountains, 0.3 clouds, and 0.2 rivers to make a Bob Ross painting. 

My project will be a bit more complex, but not much. How can I score the components? I’d like to incorporate into machine learning for testing many samples
Ideally, I’d use pictures of each clouds, rivers, etc as features in the ML model (if possible) 
Thanks for your time!
