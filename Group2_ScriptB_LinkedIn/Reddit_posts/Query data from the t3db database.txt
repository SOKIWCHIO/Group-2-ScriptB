Title: Query data from the t3db database

Content:
Beginner to bioinformatics, so please be kind.
Can anybody point me to resources to learn how to query data (Uniprot ID for protein toxins that meet certain criteria) from the t3db database. 
Do I need to download the entire database and do it locally in my machine? 
Thanks
