Title: Question: Applications of machine-learning to aid in the reconstruction of creatures from bones or fossils ?

Content:
Hello r/biology

I am a computer scientist who has been reading up on the latest understanding of dinosaurs and I got to thinking: Is anyone using machine learning for this? I used google scholar to search “Artificial intelligence paleontology” and again for reconstruction. I didn’t find anything. 

I figured someone on here may know something about it, though I’m no frequent of reddit.

I see things like [3D lazar scanning of fossils](https://www.autodesk.com/redshift/paleontology-technology-3d-laser-scanner/) is happening, and I skimmed [this VERY COOL article ](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113523) about some folks attempting to generate research-grade information from various biological datasets, with excellent results  “We address this question by pitting our system's results against those of human-constructed databases at several levels of granularity, from individual facts that describe opinions on the biological classification of taxa to synthetic results that summarize the history of genus-level biodiversity over millions of years. In all cases, we show that PDD produces data with quality that is comparable to that generated by humans, even when only small amounts of training data are available.” 

My focus is in computational geometry so I am no machine learning expert but I am familiar with various learning algorithms and techniques. I am fairly confident that you could use existing morphological datasets or laser scans of non-extinct animals and their bones to make some magic guesstimates.
