Title: Quickest Way to Create a Floor Plan

Content:
I am considering an application for in door navigation. And the first step is to map out the floor plan. Imagine your local walmart supercenter 180K square feet, and a regular walmart of 40K sqf.

Approaches that I have explored:

1. SLAM/Photogrammetry (which requires a significant amount of videos/images)
2. Roomplan (based on ARkit) like technology requires a Lidar and seem to require someone pointing the camera to all the viewable spaces.

Approaches above all seem to build from scratch. I am wondering if there is a "large model" that understands the 3D world that can translate this 2d projection back to the 3d world / 2d floorplan easily. 

As a incapable human being, I feel a far-out view can almost build the whole floor map (even using a wide angle camera, the 0.5x on my iphone), if I take a photo at the corners of a store, I can probably map 90% of the floor plan.

Is there any technique or machine learning that does this?

Output:

1. minimally, it should generate a 2D binary map (almost a bitmap of walkable floor and not walkable floor)
2. extra credits, it can generate a 3D knowing the shelf height, etc. and label the proper aisle number, .etc.

Comments:
- Depth estimation model + camera calibration can give you this to a certain extent. Essentially if you had depth information, you can get 3d points for each pixel. Then you can set the z coordinate to zero of points of certain height. 

You can do this multiple times and register the pointclouds using ICP for a complete map.
- Sensei, can you point me to some resources or libraries? Really curious how to pull it off.
