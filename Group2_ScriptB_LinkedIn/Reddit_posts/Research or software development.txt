Title: Research or software development

Content:
Dear hive mind, I'm in the fortunate position to have offers for two positions. They pay both basically the same however
1. Position 1 is in a large, multinational company which is currently modernizing it's product portfolio and invests heavily in research and development, where I would work on ML models for all sorts of products. I would be required to be at the office about 50% of the time and attendance is tracked using some app. The tech stack is somewhat out of date but modernizing it would be part of my tasks. Here I could learn a lot about several different domains of machine learning and data science. 
2. Position 2 is at a former startup which was recently bought by a larger company. I would have 100% wfh and a very modern tech stack, however my work would focus strongly on a very narrow range of models which are interesting to one single industry. However, this company is basically a software company so that I could learn a lot about software development and ML engineering. 

So what position would you take? I tend towards position 1 because I liked doing research at university (did my PhD in math) but position 2 seems to have better benefits and engineering is interesting as well? Also I think the skills I learn at position 1 are more valuable when switching jobs again, but I'm not sure about that. 

What would be the key factors you are looking for when considering a new position? 

Thank you all in advance. 

Edit: for reference, I'm living in Europe and have worked as a data scientist for four years, currently being a senior DS. 

Comments:
- I would go with position 2:

1. Tracking attendance with some app is completely crazy in my eyes. 
2. Research positions are more economically driven and thus more susceptible to losing. 
3. Personally I think engineering skills are more transferable than research

- Bro, trust me getting tracked with attendance is one line of straight up micromanagement and it will make ur life hell.
- I wouldn’t work anywhere that tracked my attendance via an app

Things like this indicate a company’s values and I’d expect them to be doing other bullshit as well.
- 2 sounds better. tracking your office attendance with an app sounds like a nightmare. having to "modernise" a tech stack will also be a painful job, especially in a large company - you will not just be able to install packages and do things as you want, everything will have to be approved, there will be a shit tonne of red tape to getting what you want, etc. also like someone else said consider your direct manager, a good or bad one will have a large influence on whether you want to neck yourself every day or not.
- What about your manager and team? In my experience, the manager and team have a much larger impact on your success and happiness than than the company or even your exact role.

If possible, pick that manager that's been there a while, has been promoted and helped others get promoted on their team, has a great relationship with their own manager, and knows how to navigate and shield their team from company bureaucracy, and fosters an environment of cultivation and growth. 

Congratulations and good luck!
- Position 2. The job responsibilities would be more focused and you will be focused on one domain and developing certain skill sets. I vote for specialization when choosing career path. Be the expert.

- Being actively tracked at #1 sounds horrible. Like are their employees children? An organization doing that probably has a ton of other 'old' attitudes in their culture, which means frustrations and possible economic problems when their oldness catches up with them. The main benefit at #1 is the breadth of domains and opportunity to work with more different stakeholders to figure out their needs and translate that into projects, IMO. Whereas #2 sounds much more narrow and probably more about pushing the performance of the model/deployment.

TLDR: I see a lot more downsides with #1, so lean towards #2.

Some other things to consider are the team and your boss (who do you want to work with the most, this is probably the most important factor day-to-day); longevity (where would you rather stay for several years); which set of skills do you prefer developing (stakeholder management/interpersonal/project skills vs pure SWE)

- 2 sounds better!
- research
- I feel like #1 gives you more opportunities in the future, and you seem to prefer the work. Assuming not full time remote isn't a dealbreaker for you? Although the tracking attendance with an app thing is sus, I would take that as a red flag.
- I have a PhD in computer science and 20 years of professional experience. I would go for position 1. Much better carcere perspectives or, anyway, you will be able to resell your experience much better in future.

Time tracking is not an issue if you are not willing to cheat somehow.
- 2 but boils down to $$$ as a tie breaker and perceived prestige in industry of choice 1
- Option 1 doesn't sound so right to me. I'd stick with research.
- 2! Run from anywhere that tracks attendence

- Thanks a lot!
