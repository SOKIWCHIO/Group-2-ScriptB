To develop their computational model, the researchers exposed A. baumannii to around 7,500 chemical compounds in a lab setting.  
  
By feeding the structure of each molecule into the model and indicating whether it inhibited bacterial growth, the algorithm learned the chemical features associated with growth suppression.
