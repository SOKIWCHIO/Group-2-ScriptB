I'm currently seeking internship opportunities in the field of Computer Vision and Robotics, and I’ll soon begin looking for full-time roles as well. I'm not sure why I don't get callbacks. I understand that Computer Vision is a highly competitive field, often leaning toward candidates with PhDs, but I want to make sure my resume isn't the issue or worse, total trash.

I've looked through other resume review posts too, and now I’d really appreciate some honest feedback and suggestions on how I can improve mine.

  
Note : I'm an international student at US!

Comments:
- Not that I hire specifically for computer vision, but some general notes. 

Lots of technical jargon with little metrics that are significant to a hiring/project manager. Metrics like accuracy are impressive to people like you and I, but how much time/money does that save the department? I know you are fresh out of school here but just try to keep that in mind. Seems like you have a good skill set, best of luck to you!
- Thanks for the input.

Would you suggest I rather remove those. Since I don’t have any work experience where I could improve monetarily, I wasn’t sure what I should put. Also these resume parsers told like we should have numbers quantified etc in resume.
