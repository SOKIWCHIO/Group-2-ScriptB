Title: Rh positive mother, rh negative baby?

Content:
I'm learning about Rh factors and erythroblastosis fetalis. I understand the complications surrounding the Rh-/Rh+ mother/fetus. But in the event of the reversed role (Rh+/Rh- mother/fetus) wouldn't the fetus' immune system produce antibodies against the mother?
