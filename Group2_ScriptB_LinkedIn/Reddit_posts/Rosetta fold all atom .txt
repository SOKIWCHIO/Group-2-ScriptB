Hi guys, I couldn't set up RFAA on my computer, that is why, I am using tamarindbio website to test some structures on RFAA. However, it limits the length of the amino acids up to 700, so I cannot put there most of the structures that I want. I want to see if RFAA predict 8FLW ( antibody-virus envelope complex) right because alphafold3 cannot do it. Please someone help me on this, I would really appreciate it if someone does it and send me the result. Thank you in advance! Note: I am just doing it to learn!!!
