Title: Seeking Career Advice: Research Analyst in a CRO Exploring Advancement Opportunities

Content:
Hello, Reddit community!

I'm at a pivotal point in my career and am seeking your advice and insights. For the past three years, I've worked as a Research Analyst at a Clinical Research Organization (CRO) within a hospital. I've been involved in a variety of clinical trials and have co-authored around 20 published papers.

My background includes a Master's degree in Economics. Although I don't have a PhD or medical degree, my superiors have generously included me in their research, which has given me a wealth of experience and sparked my curiosity in expanding my knowledge, particularly in statistical methodologies and medical concepts.

Now, I'm considering my next steps and how I might advance my career, whether within my current institution or externally. Here are some questions I'm hoping this community can help with:

1. Has anyone with a similar background (Economics Master's degree, research analyst in a CRO) transitioned into a more research-intensive or statistically demanding role? Could you share your journey and how you navigated this transition?
2. What transferable skills from my current role might be beneficial in a more research or statistics-focused role?
3. Can anyone recommend resources (books, online courses, etc.) to deepen my understanding of statistical methodologies and medical concepts?
4. Are there networking groups or professional organizations that would be beneficial for someone looking to advance their career in the field of clinical research or health economics?

I understand that career transitions often involve uncertainty, but I'm ready to embrace this challenge and eager to learn as much as I can along the way. I greatly appreciate any insights, advice, or personal stories you can share.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post and for any guidance you can provide!
