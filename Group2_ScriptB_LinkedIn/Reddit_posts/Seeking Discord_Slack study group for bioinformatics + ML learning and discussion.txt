Title: Seeking Discord/Slack study group for bioinformatics + ML learning and discussion

Content:
Hi everyone,

I am a final-year CS student transitioning into **bioinformatics and AI/ML for genomics**. I am seeking **active Discord or Slack communities** where learners and practitioners discuss:

* Genomic data analysis workflows
* Machine learning applications in bioinformatics
* Career pathways and practical project ideas
* Study accountability and collaborative learning

I find learning with a community keeps me motivated, especially while exploring **practical bioinformatics pipelines and ML integration with genomic data**.

If you know any **open, active communities** or if you have one you recommend, I would be grateful if you could share the invite link or name.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Warm regards,  
Gayathri

- The subreddit already has a slack group, and has channels for many of those topics. 

See the “before you post” post for more information
- Thank you for reading and any guidance you can share!  
I am especially looking for **active, beginner-friendly communities** where I can learn and contribute gradually while building solid skills in **bioinformatics pipelines and ML for genomics.**

If you have any advice on **getting started practically** in this area, or communities you found helpful during your learning journey, I would love to hear.

Thanks again for your time!

- I think reading different papers and work notes available in internet will help you. Next take help from ChatGPT and the like to build up a preliminary understanding. I am also not aware of any such group so can't help you in this regard, sorry!!
