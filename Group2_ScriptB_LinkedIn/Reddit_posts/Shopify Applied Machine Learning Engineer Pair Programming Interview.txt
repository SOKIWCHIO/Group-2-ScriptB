Title: Shopify Applied Machine Learning Engineer Pair Programming Interview

Content:
Has anyone done the pair programming interview with Shopify? 

Currently interviewing for a Machine Learning Engineer position and the description is really vague.  
All I know is that I can use AI tools and that they don't like Leetcode.  
It will be pair programming and bring your own IDE, but beyond this I really have no idea what to expect and how to prepare.

  
My interview is in a week - I'd really appreciate any guidance and help, thank you!

(also based in Canada, flair says US only for some reason)

- Commenting to come back here
- Bumping this, would appreciate if you can share what your experience was like if you had your interview already. Thanks!
- How did it go?
