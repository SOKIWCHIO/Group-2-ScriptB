Title: Should I attempt to do machine learning project without business need

Content:
   
I have an incompetent data science manager and an organization that is very low on data science expertise. They have hired many data scientists and promoted numerous database engineers and analysts to data science roles. Management only wants to hear about how machine learning can save money and refuses to consider the challenges involved. We have a fraud and counterfeit problem. The directive we receive is, "Hey, data scientists and AI experts, we know machine learning can be used for fraud detection, so save us X millions of dollars using machine learning." However, when we investigate closely, we find many discrepancies. The only commonality between the types of fraud in our organization and the types of fraud where machine learning is successfully used is the word "fraud." The manager either doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand. This has been happening for close to three years (even before I joined the company). It's a large organization with data scattered everywhere and many quality issues. We also don't receive many requirements from the business. I'm used to receiving a business requirement and then working with the business to determine if there's a machine learning use case, and then proceeding from there, justifying each step. However, the manager wants us to randomly come up with a use case and then go and talk to stakeholders. Does that ever work in a large organization? Most of the time, we don't even get a reply from them because they are too busy. It's even difficult to determine what is worth working on without involving the business from the beginning. The business is going to be the ultimate entity that implements our solution, so how can we do it without getting buy-in upfront? Do you have any experience navigating this kind of situation? For context, the size of the org is 100,000+ employees. 

Comments:
- Sounds like a no win situation. I'd be looking for another job.
- "I mean, it should be very easy. Just make another chatgpt model, in house"


Yeah, a large companies leader told that to me in a meeting. So you are not alone. But, you will have to do what manager tells you to.
- This is a pretty typical situation to be in when you start progressing past a junior stage - around 3-5 years of experience / manager DS

In general I would say: 
1) If you are more junior than that , this is very unusual 
2) If you are already at that level, you will find that from now on part of the job is to add value to the company through thought leadership. It is just simply not going to be the case that for every initiative you get clear requirements from the business- mainly because they aren’t experts in your field, like you (how would they even know what an ML opportunity even looks like…?) 
3) Generally speaking, at all levels of DS you should still only pursue something concretely if it makes sense and will add value to the business- or, make your reservations known, disagree, and then do it anyways, and give 100%. In industry your leadership has the last word. 
4) in general , most of your projects should have buy in before you spend lots of time and a clear path to market- talk to other teams if thats not the case - goals help here
5) Crucially in DS- not all projects should be like this. You need to be 1-2 steps ahead of the business - that means not everything is fully specced. / could be foundational
6) Lastly, remember- you are part of the business. In DS , your role is a bit unusual in that if you want to succeed and add value, you should NOT always just “do what you are asked” (ex-my above, imo) At the core you are a problem solver - that means in general it’s sometimes necessary to identify opportunities and get after them - whether others see them yet or not. Balance this vs. the fact you work in a company- you will not succeed over the long term without others

Good luck!
- My typical response when someone asks me to build an ML model when ML is the wrong solution is that I build an "ensemble model" that uses some ML plus whatever other model is actually appropriate. Then I just set the rules of the ensemble to favour the model I know will actually work.

Totally ridiculous and a waste of time, but it usually delivers and keeps everyone happy. Management can brag about having a machine learning solution and operations get something that actually delivers.
- The only useful response to this is the guy saying you should look for another job. This sounds exactly like some of the banks I have worked for in the past. Under these conditions it's very difficult to ever do any truly impactful work. Instead you will be mainly working on 'POCs' that the business do not care about. Data Science can never work without proper leadership and this is beyond the capacity of data scientists at your level.

So you have two options, become extremely adept at your companies politics and ride the gravy train or leave your organisation.
- I think you probably do need business buy-in, especially if it’s a more old school organization that might be less interested in employees “going rogue” even if it ends up working out and providing value. From my experience, you need at least some trust to be able to pursue things that upper management may see as “passion projects” regardless of whether you’ll end up developing something that is beneficial to the organization. It’s a hard sell for a lot of orgs that have a very specific definition of what they want developed and how they want it to impact current infrastructure.
- Not sure if this is at all feasible, but in my experience, stakeholders love, love, love to complain about this or that. You being the data guy can get a mouthful from them, and sometimes you do hear something enough, some solvable thing that they complain about, and you have your use case. But you can't figure that out from one meeting, one interaction, you have to sort of hang out or at least meet with them in official and unofficial ways. Very unscientific I know, but eons ago I moved to a division as the data analytics guy, and in my first week, VP's were threatening to get me fired if I didn't "fix it", whatever "it" was. So, I dug in and listened, no judgement, and soon I got an idea that could "prove" my worth by solving a problem they perceived as a problem. 

It worked, and they began to come to me to solve this, address that, but were much more cordial, and began to include me in their meetings. If there is any way to even metaphorically sit with your stakeholders, get to know them, and for them to get to know you, that is the best way to help them.
- "Ai" doesn't mean 100% automation and 100% success but yeah hard to even convey that message to the clueless.

For fraud protection, make a model that is good at ranking the most likley cases of fraud. In essence people get flagged that rank high enough, then a human must look at it. If done correctly it reduces human work (saves money) while keeping fraud constant, best case both go down.
- Then you better invent a new type of machine learning quick!
- Are you able to get access to all the data that you need? Do you understand how the data is generated and what the gotchas could be? Are you free to independently work on promising solutions that you can pitch to your boss? Are you free to connect with people 1-3 levels below your business leads to get the context that you need to ensure the modeling solves a real business problem? Are you safe some politics of credit if you just drive a solution? If the answers to these questions are yes, i would go ahead with solving the problem yourself. Ideally you have confidantes in the business side that can help you navigate the politics.
- You are walking into a situation where you are putting yourself at risk. 

If a manager can’t figure out what is involved with the problem, you are going to be blamed for cost overruns and failures. 

You need to stop and do a full walkthrough with a decision maker before you get blamed for failure or you get blamed on dirty data or any number of 10,000 things that can go wrong.
- AmEx?

How do I join?
- The issue stems from dysfunctional leadership and a fundamental misunderstanding of data science's role in business strategy. Expecting data scientists to independently find impactful use cases without clear business requirements or strategic direction is ineffective, especially in a large organization where stakeholder engagement is crucial. This approach might work in smaller settings with more direct communication, but in a large company like yours, it leads to wasted efforts and frustration. Without a strategic approach and alignment with business needs, meaningful outcomes are unlikely.

I would be learning as much as I can while i am working there but ultimately I would be looking for another job
- It seems that you are in a situation where you need to hunt for a good use case, which is very common in large companies. Start by understanding the Company well, what does the company produce? What are the key metrics? What are the key decisions? What parameters are involved in those decisions? Which of those can you improve with ML? How much would that impact the metric? Who makes those decisions?

Partner with people who are at the same level as you in the org. Young individual contributors eager to do better.

I'll give you an example, all companies that make something hold inventory. If the lead time prediction were more accurate you would have better inventory targets. Forecasts is another common one.
- In your situation, I would change my company.
- Run away. if you are not a genius data scientist, you cannot solve those problems without business inputs.
- I am curious... What are the types of fraud in your organization? You mentioned counterfeit, and I am aware of ML uses for counterfeit detection, but it requires certain data qualities and preparation that may be lacking in your organization, which would be where your org should focus (capturing the right data).

Anyhow, I've worked with incompetent management before, trying to push ML on problems that can be solved with a simple sql query. You just push back! You should be able to explain why a solution won't work using reason and mathematical proof (as a data scientist), but you should also provide an alternative. If your manager insists on ML, they also should be able to justify with evidence or examples. If you can't explain your position, then it is weak! Perhaps you are the incompetent data scientist?!. If they can't explain theirs, then keep pushing back until they can or leave them.

Note: the argument "fraud in other places where ML is applied is not of the same type as our fraud" on its own Is not a justification. It only means "I am not a data scientist, I just copy data science code from other data scientists who solved the same problem".
- Just do what they do, float ideas show challenges maybe the work gets done or maybe its a hald baked solution, kinda doesn’t matter. Just act interested and see how you can sway stakeholders. Sway them in the direction of least bullshit or minimal work up to you
- My industry doesn't often add new business requirements related to machine learning, and the actual demand isn't that big.  
So, when there are no relevant official projects to work on, I try to do the following:  
1. Visit this Sub to get a sense of the latest trends in data science and try to answer some questions as much as possible.  
2. Check out TowardsDataScience.  
3. Buy some of the latest related books to read, and try to write the code from the books myself.  
4. Participate in some Kaggle competitions and communicate with other teams.  
5. Try writing a blog to share what I know and get feedback.  
Hope this can give you some reference.
- Answering the title question: absolutely not. Taking a use case to the stakeholders is fraught with danger - what's likely to happen is they don't really understand, they shrug and say "sure, go ahead and do it" and then after a large amount of work you give them a final product and they never use it.
