Title: Showcasing TEMAS: Modular 3D sensor platform (RGB + LiDAR + ToF) – calibrated & synchronized out of the box

Content:
Hey everyone,
we’re on our Road to Kickstarter and recently showcased TEMAS at KI Palooza (AI conference in Germany).

What TEMAS is:

Modular 3D sensor platform combining RGB camera + LiDAR + ToF

All sensors are pre-calibrated and synchronized, so you get reliable data right away

Powered by Raspberry Pi 5 and scalable with AI accelerators like Jetson or Hailo for advanced machine learning tasks.

Delivers colorized 3D point clouds

Accessible via PyPi Lib(pip install rubu)

We’d love your thoughts:

Which computer vision use cases would benefit most from an all-in-one, pre-calibrated sensor platform like this?
