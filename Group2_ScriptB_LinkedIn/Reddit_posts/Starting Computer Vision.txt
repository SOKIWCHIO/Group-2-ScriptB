Title: Starting Computer Vision

Content:
I am a current grad student in machine learning. I am developing an interest in how computer vision works. I am a complete layman regarding CV, but it fascinates me. Can you recommend where to start on CV basics and also if there are some research papers I should go through

Comments:
- Do you know what sub-area of CV you're interested in? that could be 3D reconstruction, detection/classification, image restoration...
- This may help:

- This series by Shree Nayar gives a nice introduction to many low-level computer vision problems, some related to robotics: https://fpcv.cs.columbia.edu/
- I am interested in the robotics application of it (for eg motion planning) and also as you said detection/classification
- Thanks! I did a general overview of the exercises, they look great
