Comments:
- just to make it clear [NGSchool Society](http://ngschool.eu/) is a non profit organisation registered as such in Poland. Our events are non-profit and all organizers are volunteering their time. We apply for funding that allows us to subsidize the cost of the events and with current funding schemes we are unable to offer remuneration to invited speakers. We do cover their travel expenses, accommodation and board.  


We try to make our events accessible and affordable for all, and keep the registration fees to a minimum. We understand that in some circumstances even the fees we set can be challenging. We don't want the money to be a limiting factor in anyone's participation - if you find it difficult to fund your registration fee, please still consider applying and reach out explaining your situation and we will try our best to help you with a reduced fee or a waiver.
- We updated event website with **program and speakers**! Be sure to check it out, registration is open until 30.05 - don't miss out! https://ngschool.eu/ngschool2022/
