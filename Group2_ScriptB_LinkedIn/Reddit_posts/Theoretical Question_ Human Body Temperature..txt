Title: Theoretical Question: Human Body Temperature.

Content:
So I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask but I thought going where experts are was the best idea.

I'm an avid fan of ttrpgs and superhero stuff, issue is I have a habit of trying to reseach the most believable and realistic explanations behind how things work. Sometimes though I lack the right knowledge to research some ideas.

Here's the question I need answered. If a humans body was permanently stuck at being lukewarm temperature (Around 98* Fahrenheit) and nothing could externally or internally change this fact. What kinda of feats could they accomplish?

I know that machines are limited in their ability to perform at higher capacities for long periods of time due to overheating. I wondered if this would work the same for the character I'm designing. I just can't really think what sort of inhuman feats they could accomplish with a permanently regulated body temperature.

So if anyone can offer some ideas, advice, or theories it'd be much appreciated. I love biology and science in general so I see this as a learning opportunity as well.

Comments:
- What's the temp of "lukewarm"?
- Well, if it were always around 98 and couldn’t be changed, we’d be able to swim in arctic waters without risking hypothermia. Cold water shock could still potentially be an issue, though unlikely if our body temp was unchangeable. We could also run/exercise without overheating, and we could work outside on hot days without risking heatstroke.
- You need to know certain metabolic enzymes need to work within strict temperature limits.
- General consensus is body temperature. Around  98* Fahrenheit.
- To be even more specific with the circumstances the person's body radiates an almost skin tight aura of energy that instantly converts anything inside to bring lukewarm in temperature. 

It started as a joke idea but the biological implications have been nagging at my brain for awhile now. I realized someone like this might have a lower immune system due to their body being unable to produce a fever to combat sickness. 

Would being unable to over heat allow someone to exercise longer and more efficiently thus speeding up the growth of muscle mass? Is there a way to overclock your body like a piece of technology?
- Ok tell me more! I wanna learn what I can about this to better portray the character.
- So 36-37° Celsius? And what's superpower about it if it's just normal body temperature?
- I’m not sure if the body could be overclocked, but theoretically you could exercise longer and harder if overheating wasn’t an issue. Of course, your muscles would still fatigue, and you’d still need good nutrition, but hydration wouldn’t be as challenging.
- Not at 3am. Go review your old A&P textbooks.
- Yeah, but the body temp is the exact strict temp limit they need.

So their proteins would always be efficient, don't know what kind of impact this would have though xD
- The actual power is an almost skin tight aura of energy that converts anything inside to lukewarm temperature instantly. Making it so they can walk through solid ice and ignore the heat if the sun etc.
- Yeah the lactic acids would cause fatigue even at optimal temperatures. Hydration would be practically a cake walk since you'd never sweat from heat.

I'll need to think more on this.
- I don't have any of those but I'll keep that in mind later for research.
- Oh in this sense yeah sure.

But it also means that they're weak to virus-bacterial infections xD

But other than being able to resist temperature outside and not overheating, it doesn't come anything else in my mind.

Them not overhearing would make possible to wear a 24h suit that protects it both physically and chemically from the outside.
- Yeah I've written in that they have a weaker immune system since their body literally can't catch a fever in response to getting sick. Among other things.
