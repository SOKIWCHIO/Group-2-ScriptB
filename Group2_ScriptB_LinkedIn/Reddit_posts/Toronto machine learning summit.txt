How to get free tickets? 

Is it worth going ? 

Is it a networking event?

- Looking at: https://www.torontomachinelearning.com/

It appears that there is networking and workshops that take place in-person (at RBC WaterPark Place in Toronto) and online within different platforms. For example, some networking takes place on Whova and some workshops are virtual on Google Meet.

As for free tickets, I see no sign of that.
- Is something similar happening in Ottawa if you know ?
