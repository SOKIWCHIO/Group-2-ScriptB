Title: Tumor Dimensions Dataset

Content:
Hi all!

I've been working on developing a model that classifies whether a tumor is benign or malignant. I've been using the tumor's dimensions as training features for the model.

The issue I'm facing is that my current dataset contains too few instances (569). I've been using UCI's Breast Cancer Dataset ([Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) - UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)).

Is anyone familiar with a similar dataset that I can either combine on or work from? I'm hoping for a minimum thousand instances after combining (or a thousand instances from the new dataset).

Any help is appreciated ðŸ˜Š
