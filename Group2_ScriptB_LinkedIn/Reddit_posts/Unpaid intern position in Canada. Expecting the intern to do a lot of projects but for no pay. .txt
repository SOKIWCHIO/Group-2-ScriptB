- From that About The Company description, I don't even understand what that company does. Do they also sell candy?
- Sounds like a great opportunity for wage theft.
- It would be awful if this company was bombed with thousands of fake applications
- Check Canadian labor laws. In the USA, this would be illegal. 

If it was me and the job was in the USA, I would not mention it when you apply as it will only cause them to avoid me. I would get in, then if I realize indeed that I am doing work with no pay, I'd file a lawsuit.

Anyway, the company seems to be one of the many indian staffing firms that have honestly plagued the US market by evading labor laws and manipulating the system. Chances are they'll just rebrand you and fake your CV, then sell you to actual firms as an experienced data scientist. Sure, you'll get to learn a few things, work on some fake (or duplicate) projects, and this may indeed be helpful to desperate internationals who can't find jobs. But you know how there are talks about folks in the field suffering from imposter syndrome? These companies produce real imposters, no syndrome.
- STAY AWAY FROM OENSON

its just a scam company, full of unpaid interns from  around the world. No real learnings.
- Well with how over saturated Canada’s job market is, you’d be surprised by how many good applicants will apply to this, with hopes of gaining networking opportunities and experience. 

This company can literally get away with making false promises for free labour.
- No pay, but look at all the LEARNING you get to do? So much free, unpaid learning!
- I think I applied for them to get some experience but when they get in touch you find out they're actually shilling a bootcamp 

Good luck.
- Most likely they will also ask you to pay them some money because it's a scam listing. Check the contact person's location, they will most likely will be in another part of the globe. This is most likely a consultancy which most people use for H1b fraud.
- Yeah no, fuck that
- Unless you are a student doing this as part of your school, unpaid internships are illegal in Canada.
- Let's turn this around to the company's side... What are you really expecting out of this? The salary may be unpaid but interviewing, hiring, and onboarding this person isn't free.

I have a friend who owns his own engineering firm. He found out the hard way what happens and who you end up with when you low ball your engineering talent. It ended up far more damaging than he ever imagined.
- I always see this one ad here in Australia too, it feels like it’s a major scam when you look up the company
- I thought Canada had a rule for this?
- I know for Ontario at least this is illegal. Given this is remote, this is an illegal job posting and you should report it to the government if you know how. Internships that are not paid are not allowed to do any work that would financially benefit the organization basically.
- They will ask money to give you training!  
I think I have dealt with this company though with a different name. They wanted some $400 to give me training
- NAH!!!! I know this company they have ads for internships where you have to pay them. STAY AWAY.
- They are scam indian companies
- I'm in Australia and I just stumbled upon these and reported multiple of their "unpaid" jobs and company as these violate our Fair Work laws. They just don't want to pay employees it looks like, just have 100s of remote unpaid interns. My browser wouldn't even let me open the website so the exploitation could be the least of their crimes, hope no one falls for it :(
- Trudeau gonna bring more immigrants for data science
