- I've been down voted to hell in the past for these comments, but I'm gonna keep saying it.

One of the biggest gaps I always complain about is business domain knowledge. We have some very solid developers, very solid data scientists, but they don't understand the business.

When you don't understand the business, you can't architect solutions because you don't actually have an intimate understanding of the problems.

My undergrad was in finance, and I spent more than a decade as an underwriter in commercial real estate. I ended up getting bored in my job, so I went back to school to get an MS in data science and transitioned into a new, more tech focused role. I constantly hear complaints from our sales teams that our IT folks can't speak their language. 

Frankly, I'm not much of a data scientist, but I understand the business and the industry very well, and I know enough about data science to know what we can and cannot achieve. That's where I actually deliver value and why they keep paying me as much as they do.

EDIT: Should have just mentioned that when I'm looking to hire, I'll take someone who is technically very average but has robust knowledge of the business. It's so much easier to fix technically average than it is to train on business domain knowledge, which really only comes from years in the trenches.
- Missing figures, percentages, increases, efficiencies, etc.
- I do like the structure of each bullet - accessible wording on what you did followed by impact. 

The only thing I see, and this is an issue across many strong resumes, is the points are scattered and only vaguely connected, making it seem like these were tasks handed to you and you completed them. As you move to mid or senior level, there needs to be a common thread to show how you can show the big picture of what you do for the business. How do you lead vs how are guided by others?
- Looks better! Good luck in the interview journey and don’t forget to prep for it, this GitHub repo has some DS interview questions: https://github.com/TidorP/MLJobSearch2025
- Hey buddy,

You can actually condense your resume further and quantify your achievements to better showcase your business acumen and data-driven approach.

Second, add a brief summary at the very beginning (once you trim down the experience section). This should include: who you are, the role you’re applying for, and your total years of experience. This makes it easier for HR to quickly grasp your profile instead of calculating it from your experience timeline.

Place Education above the skills section. Education can reflect dynamic growth, even if the job itself is static in terms of tech stack or responsibilities. If relevant, include other certifications with timelines—this demonstrates a proactive learning attitude, which is a strong positive signal for recruiters.

Skills can be listed last. Detailed subsections aren’t necessary unless explicitly requested in the job description. For example, a Data Scientist using AWS would likely be familiar with SageMaker; there’s no need to over-specify unless the company has a specialized setup.You can highlight key technologies directly mentioned in the JD

Finally, include your LinkedIn profile alongside your email and other contact info. If you’ve done side projects, add a GitHub link (inside your linkedin profile) to showcase them.

Hope this helps!

Cheers.
- So good, 😊 which u 🍀 luck
- You build a system that automated \~23 full time jobs? Assuming a full-time job has around 1800 working hours per year?
- I will be honest, there is absolutely no hope for anyone looking for IT jobs right now. Noone is hiring and noone is firing. There are very low number of positions
- Funny you say that because a hiring manager i interviewed with didnt care about domain knowledge
- You should be hiring teams, not individuals.

Business knowledge won't get you to production. Lots of "planning" and "prototyping" and other types of hand waving but nothing gets shipped or it takes a full year.

Highly technical people can attend a meeting monday morning, have a prototype by Wednesday and ship something to production by Friday. If your team has a competent product owner and business people attached on a per-project basis then you have a highly efficient team.

It's a lot better because people deeply specialize instead of being equally shit at everything.

Shit managers at shit companies will hire a bunch of shit lone wolves that don't collaborate and expect them to be unicorns while paying them shit.
- Reallly ?!?
- If you are looking to hire I would appreciate a possible interview. 

I have a degree in Computer science and Economics and a honours in Computer Science with freelance experience in data science. I am also starting my masters in DC next year.
- its Much easier to pick up business domain knowledge than graduate level stats and ML
- I was thinking the same thing. As a hiring manager I would have no idea what this person is really good at - they seem to be a broad generalist (models, etl, dashboards, etc). It’s hard to find the narrative.
- 25 mins per day across 250 sites.
- That company is probably a red flag to work for I’m afraid
- Lol...that is funny
- >It's a lot better because people deeply specialize instead of being equally shit at everything.

The guy argued about average technical knowledge, not being equally shit at everything.

Also, human essentially dominate the world through multi-skills rather than hyper-specialists. A lot of invention is actually based on the knowledge from different domains, or collab of multi domain, rather than a niche field. 

Getting production without business knowledge costs money and team trust.
- Yes??
- I suppose it probably depends on the business domain you're working in.
