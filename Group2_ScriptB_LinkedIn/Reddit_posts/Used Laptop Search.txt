Title: Used Laptop Search

Content:
I am a current college student searching for a used laptop because my current machine has run into memory limitations when studying machine learning. What advice would you give me for making sure I avoid scams and make a safe decision? Any specific sites/sellers you would recommend I look at or avoid?

Comments:
- I wouldnt buy a laptop - check out google colab or paper space.
- Do you have access to an HPC through your University? I can run massive operations through a terminal app on my phone since I've pushed everything to a supercomputer.
If not, consider Amazon cloud computing. Maybe your uni would pay for that?

A new laptop is probably not the answer, sorry to say
- A laptop is not going to have a powerful enough cpu or gpu to do machine learning. Even if you get more memory you will run into other limits. 

Stick with the current laptop and farm it out as others here suggest.
