Title: We are Team Manipal BioMachines and we need your help to participate in iGEM 2020!

Greetings from Manipal BioMachines!

We are a group of highly motivated students from various disciplines, working together in the field of synthetic biology and genetic engineering to find a solution to methylmercury poisoning, the underlying cause for catastrophic disasters like the Minamata disease and the Basra Poison Grain disaster.Â 

The MIT Manipal iGEM Team will attempt to give the proof of concept of a probiotic bacterium which can convert methylmercury to elemental mercury to reduce its toxic potential. We will also extensively survey the effects of industrial effluent discharge with the incidences of neurological disorders and theoretically develop a probiotic product based on our bacterium capable of tackling methylmercury poisoning.

We want to present this project at the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition. The iGEM Foundation is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of synthetic biology and applied biotechnology to find solutions to real-life problems. iGEM attempts to change the way Biology is taught and understood, allowing students to learn by doing and creating.

Participation in this competition requires us attend the 2020 edition of the Giant Jamboree, the culmination event of iGEM. We wish to seek your help to procure funds for the same.

We hope you can help us pioneer this effort and represent MIT, MAHE at a global stage.
