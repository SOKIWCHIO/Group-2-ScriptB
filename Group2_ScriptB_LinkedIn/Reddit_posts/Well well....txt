- Really love the Indian students on LinkedIn who havenâ€™t graduated but tell me what is data science.
- Quality shitpost
- it's not just X... it's Y!
- College student mentality ðŸ˜‚
- Itâ€™s missing computer scientist controlling the data scientist and then a mathematician controlling the computer scientist
- Or basically are three jobs in one role? Thats what im doing :(
- There's something wrong with the visuization
- I just wish some people were barred from LLM's ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
- Meanwhile all the data scientists in my company know nothing about the business and are practically useless at their jobs as a result. Also lmao just posting the classic Indian LinkedIn shit
- R...who let you back in the house?
- Why would they try to do hands? The biggest indicator of bad AI, and thatâ€™s what they focus on?
- I'm going to figure out how to troll some of my team members with the terms "Cruyff dribbling" and "Cloud Panoles". I'll lie and say that they are new Data Science terms >:)
- Cruyff dribbling?
- I took data science as major for undergraduate and this is mh first semester. Iâ€™m still confused if I should change the major and take it for masters. Any suggestions?
- My fellow Indian undergrad at it again
- Yes, go stop Putin missiles with your data...
- Fuck off with the linkedin slop
- That's pretty much LinkedIn in a nutshell
- What about the philosopher on top of the mathematician?
- This was my first thought
