Title: What are the best resources for how machine learning is being applied to biology research?

Content:
It appears that there are a number of applications of ML to biomedicine. 

Any journals/blogs/etc. are appreciated. 

Comments:
- Here's what I consider one of the most influential papers on ML applied to a practical biology problem: [Gene Selection for Cancer Classification using
Support Vector Machines](http://www.clopinet.com/isabelle/Papers/geneselect.pdf)

As for journals you'll find ML papers scattered all over the place. You can find articles where ML is applied to health related stuff by going to [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=machine%20learning) and searching for Machine Learning.

Some specific researchers you might be interested in looking up would be:

Christina Leslie

David Gifford

Manolis Kellis



Also, anything to do with predicting protein functions or structures from DNA or AA sequences is based on ML methods:

[antiSMASH](http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/)

[InterProScan5](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/about.html)

[SMURF](http://jcvi.org/smurf/index.php)

Many of the databases that get published to [Nucleic Acids Research](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/) also implement ML as part of their features.
- I haven't looked into it that much, but ChromHMM might be of interest, especially if you're also interested in genetics/epigenetic
