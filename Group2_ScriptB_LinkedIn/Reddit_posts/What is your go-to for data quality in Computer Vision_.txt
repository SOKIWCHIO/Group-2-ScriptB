Title: What is your go-to for data quality in Computer Vision?

Content:
For those working on CV (unstructured data), how to you approach data quality?

I've been working with data quality for structured data, and I have my methods for assessing data quality, but I'm fairly new to CV and a bit confused about how to evaluate the quality of my data, specifically for computer vision applications.

I know that data quality is crucial for the success of any machine learning project, but when it comes to images and videos, what are the key factors I should be looking at to ensure that my data is up to par?

Are there any specific metrics or tools I should be using to measure the quality of my training data? And how can I tell if my dataset is biased or unrepresentative of the real-world scenarios I'm trying to tackle?

Any guidance or advice on assessing data quality for computer vision would be appreciated! Thanks in advance

- Well, this seems like a nice opportunity to learn about it: [https://www.linkedin.com/events/gettingstartedwiththeopensource7117177108006600707/](https://www.linkedin.com/events/gettingstartedwiththeopensource7117177108006600707/)

1 hour session, they usually record it as well
- Try using [https://sandbox.tenyks.ai](https://tenyks.docsend.com/view/cyzf9j64wytwgtaj), it's a data-centric platform that helps you evaluate/assess/check the quality of your data. It has tons of useful tools built-in to find dataset errors such as false negative filters, mispredictions, etc. 

Also, after uploading your dataset/model, you will get vector embeddings on your whole dataset for free! With this you get an image-to-image, text-to-image search (i.e. given a corrupted sample, you can find in seconds other similar samples).
