Title: What science classes should I take outside of CS / stats in undergrad?

Content:
Hi all. 

Currently an HS senior who will be attending UVA in the fall. My plan is to double major in biostatistics and biochemistry, but it's looking like that may not be a possibility. Instead of completely majoring in biochemistry, im considering taking a select few of science classes related to the subject. Here's the ones I'm considering:

-	accelerated general chemistry + lab
-	accelerated organic chemistry + lab 
-	biochemistry + lab 
-	gen bio (took AP bio in HS)
-	genetics & molecular bio 
-	microbiology 

Here's the ones from a complete biochem major that I won't take: 

-	physics 1 & 2 + lab 
-	physical chemistry + lab
-	analytic chemistry 
-	inorganic chemistry 

As much as I enjoy software engineering, I'd prefer to be a computational biologist who handles more theoretical work dealing with proteomics / biology. Additionally, I'd possibly like to do some work involving biophysics. Would not taking a physical chemistry class hinder me in this possible pursuit? 

I'd appreciate any insight. In addition to taking these classes and majoring in biostatistics (which composes of statistic classes that deal with coding), I plan on coding everyday to fill in the gaps and eventually learn machine learning. Of course, my goal is to do research as soon as my freshman year. 

Side note: I appreciate this subreddit so much! You are all so awesome and I feel so grateful to have this subreddit as a resource for my pursuits.

Edit: figured I should clarify, I fully intend to go to grad school, and I am 99% sure that this is the career path I wanna go down.

Comments:
- My two-cents and I highly recommend taking Genetics and Molecular Biology. A lot of the stuff you'll learn in this class will basically be your foundation for bioinformatics for knowing stuff on the biology side.   


Not familiar with biophysics or what classes would be useful there but hopefully some others would be able to contribute here!
- Thank you for the advice. I will for sure take that class!

Has there been any notable classes you've taken during undergrad that you're thankful you did?
- Hmm personally I’m still having a troubling time understanding why I needed Chemistry and Ochem for a lot of the stuff I’m doing, but recently in work my boss did propose an interesting thought related to biochem. 

Personally I thought a lot of the CS courses I took for my minor taught me lot about programmming and thinking through a lot of problems. Statistics is also useful for being able to interpret your data and understand what it’s trying to convey.
