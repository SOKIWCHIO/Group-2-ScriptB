Title: Which biological process can't currently be artificially created/engineered, and what would it take for us to do so?

Content:
I'm an engineer and my SO is a microbiologist. Sometimes we talk about all the cool stuff our bodies have evolved to do and I ask about whether or not these processes or parts of them could be artificially remade or replicated.  I don't know enough about biology and she doesn't know enough about engineering to provide a concrete answer all the time, but it leads to interesting speculation. I also recently read The Body" by Bill Bryson and all throughout I was thinking about how what lessons we can learn in engineering from "machines" that have evolved to work so efficiently and with so many interdependent systems. I couldn't imagine "designing" such a thing. 

My question is in the title but I'll rephrase it. What are some biological processes or systems that we could theoretically recreate, but because of technology or knowledge, we can't do it right now? What would it take for us to reach the point where we could recreate them? It wouldn't need to be an exact recreation in terms of scale or full processes like we have in our bodies, but something close enough where it accomplishes the same end goal. 

If there are any interesting books that people have read that address this question, or articles/projects that have attempted something similar, please let me know! Thanks!

Comments:
- I study viral genetics and molecular biology (I do not consider myself an expert at all), but I am fascinated by concepts like these. I think once we can confidently predict/observe all biophysical mechanics and map out their pathways (we have with certain processes), we could inevitably recreate the process given enough time. I believe we already have nano-scale tech and can readily produce enzymes, DNA, mRNA, liposomes, etc. Our limits come in the forms of access, cost, safety, and willpower...and a thorough understanding of quantum mechanics' involvement at the smallest scales. Possible? Of course. Easy? Lol.
- Not sure if functioning nephrons have been artificially synthesised yet. There seems to be a lot of "We're a step closer..." style articles but not sure if anything more concrete is out there.
- In genetic algorithms, sometime in future, you should be able to create an environment with such detail and run a simulation to evolve the most adapted creature for those environmental conditions. Also, setting up arms races, speeding up pathway search etc. At that point you are simulating conditions for any form of conceivable life just as long as you can create the details of the environment and co evolution interplay which I imagine is just not possible today.
- I would say most can’t be artificially created. You can do individual chemical reactions in a test tube, often with enzymes extracted from living tissue, but life has engineered systems that we can only understand or replicate on very basic levels.
- 15 years ago this question was fairly easy, it was the the micro"machinery" in the cell that transported, replicated, and built new structures.  With the rapid rise of nanotechnology we are well on the path to that now.  I'll be interested to see what others suggest because with better understanding of nanotechnology and quantum field I can't think of anything we couldn't manage to make.... assuming someone had the time, resources, and desire to actually make it haha.
- I think for most biological processes its not able to be artificially created because sometimes the most optimised biological systems can go extinct, non-vital and redundant and even harmful systems somehow stick around and contribute to life and thats before mentioning that the human factor is the biggest limitation. When we design something we don't know how it will turn out and if it will necessarily obey the laws of nature (or rather our own idea of the concept of the laws of nature). 

I'm not sure how naturally evolving technologies like machine learning will go given again the human factor behind its design and the inputs given to it.

I'm a bit more biased to the neuro circuitry and I have no doubt vascular structures or membranes can be produced but genetics and nervous tissue seems very complex to recreate. Even with transplanting organs, our bodies can reject 100% matches or our own organs so you never know what random chaotic haphazard thing will happen next. We can definitely progress to integrate robotics to fit human use but I'm not sure if that will necessarily be of a "biological" design. 

This is just my opinion, perhaps I'm wrong but its too soon for me to tell.
- I dont think photosynthesis is possible to recreate fully in the lab is it?
- Most of what the human brain does cannot be duplicated in the lab. It will take a lot of research to be able to understand how our brain does what it does.
- [Germinal centers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germinal_center) are amazing structures that give rise to the antibodies our immune systems use to flag and degrade invading pathogens. These centers enable the rapid generation of billions of different antibodies, selection of lead clones, and further mutation and affinity maturation, all in real time within a little-known organelle. Protein engineers have devised artificial ways to replicate this process, but primarily in a cludgy, hands-on fashion that requires highly advanced equipment and tedious genetic manipulation. Only recently have groups started to develop in vivo systems that combine mutation/diversification in-line with selection, such that the artificial process starts to look more like directed evolution (see [PACE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage-assisted_continuous_evolution), out of George Church’s lab), but even that process doesn’t come close to approximating the elegance and complexity of the germinal center.
- Could you explain more how a thorough understanding of quantum mechanics would help? Would it be any easier (or even possible) to recreate things on a larger scale to avoid relying on nanoscale tech or other dependencies. 

One example my SO and I discussed was the conversion of food to energy for us to use. I won't try to explain the biology part, because I'll probably butcher it, but I remember the process she described sounded similar to organic combustion, like burning wood to create heat. It requires something to start the burn and creates energy + waste. It's obviously way more complicated in our bodies because it's smaller and has more pieces "talking" to each other, but the high-level worming principal is similar to combustion, which we have on a larger scale.
- Right. I had in mind the example of winemaking, where we don't even know all the chemicals that get synthesized by yeasts to make a well-aged bottle of cabernet sauvignon.
- If you broke them down into small enough steps, couldn't you automate those individual chemical reactions to happen in series with the output of one bring the input of another to achieve the same end result? It probably wouldn't be as compact or efficient, but couldn't some of those processes still be recreated? Was there a more specific biological process you had in mind where that wouldn't be possible? I only took about 2 semesters of (non organic) chemistry in college, so I apologize if I'm wayyy oversimplifying something that's just too complicated to just "break down into smaller steps".
- I'm somewhat of an idealist, haha. I just like to imagine there's some point in the future where we would be able and willing to pursue those things. I was curious of the technical barriers we have, and it sounds like nanotechnology and quantum mechanics would be a very big part of it.
- **[Germinal center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germinal_center)** 
 
 >Germinal centers or germinal centres (GCs) are transiently formed structures within B  cell zone (follicles) in secondary lymphoid organs – lymph nodes, ileal Peyer's patches, and the spleen – where mature B cells are activated, proliferate, differentiate, and mutate their antibody genes (through somatic hypermutation aimed at achieving higher affinity) during a normal immune response; most of the germinal center B cells (BGC) are removed by tingible body macrophages. The B cells develop dynamically after the activation of follicular B cells by T-dependent antigen.
 
**[Phage-assisted continuous evolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage-assisted_continuous_evolution)** 
 
 >Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) is a phage-based technique for the automated directed evolution of proteins. It relies on relating the desired activity of a target protein with the fitness of an infectious bacteriophage which carries the protein’s corresponding gene. Proteins with greater desired activity hence confer greater infectivity to their carrier phage. More infectious phage propagate more effectively, selecting for advantageous mutations.

- I guess what came to mind was processes like photosynthesis that work well in harvesting energy with little input. Studies in quantum biology are showing how certain aspects of energy capture and expenditure are conducted in a more efficient way than what we can throw together at a more macro scale (I say that without actually giving any studies to reference in particular, but Nature has a few and I believe NCBI can help point some out outside of a normal Google search). It is a bit confounding to me that a huge amount of structures seemingly "find" there way to where they're needed in a cell. When it comes to translating those processes for macro scale usage (i.e. material to energy), QM could enable a more efficient process, but even with plants that do so well at capturing energy from sunlight and processing it with minimal loss, it's an overall chemical reaction that does not produce as much as it takes in. Hence plants grow slowly compared to other organisms higher up the energy food chain. The best conversion of energy we could use is fusion (we recently made progress with 700x the U.S. grid in an experiment), but I don't know of any biological process we could use on a macro-scale that would work fast enough for it to be worthwhile. Bacterial mechanisms such as feeding off chemicals in rocks even in extreme environments would be useful for sure, but the process is too slow. Speeding it up would require more energy input which takes away from the overall goal. Maybe there's some mash-up of synthetic chlorophyll solar cells that harvest light like plants do without the drawbacks of a plant or our current solar cells.
- Very interesting! That's for the information! Is there anywhere in particular you would recommend looking for more information on photosynthesis energy conversion? I'm unfamiliar with "NCBI". 

I'm similarly fascinated by our transport mechanisms. The way the immune system has so many messengers with such specific triggers and objectives is hard to wrap my head around... Especially since it "just happens" inside us.
