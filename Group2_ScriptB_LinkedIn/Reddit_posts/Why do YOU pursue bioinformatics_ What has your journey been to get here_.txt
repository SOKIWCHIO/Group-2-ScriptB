Title: Why do YOU pursue bioinformatics? What has your journey been to get here?

Content:
I know a lot of bioinformaticians and all of my colleagues have gone in for a different reason.  Personally, I went into biology because I thought it would be cool to combine different organisms when I was an undergrad; probably subconscious remains from Godzilla and Pokemon from when I was a kid.  To say it short, my interest and motivations have matured since then (33 now with a PhD).  Got into bioinformatics because I took a class and was fascinated with the idea of a minimal organism and “decoding” biological code.  Ended up getting into a stem cell internship where I was doing cloning experiments that I wasn’t into because my experiments took forever and never worked.  Started doing a side project in the lab writing code to look at ncRNA and went down the rabbit hole.  Ended up doing a MS studying bioinformatics and synthetic biology trying to make biofuels then got into metagenomics and machine learning for my PhD.  I’ve realized my biggest motivating factors is two-fold: 1) learning/creating new machine learning methods that can be used to understand ecological patterns in environments; and 2) the potential for using these findings for some aspect of climate change or sustainability.  Still working on the latter but that passion really gives me a boost when I need it the most.  I can’t imagine not having that personal attachment and pursuing bioinformatics because we are underpaid for our talents and in many cases put in more work than we get credit for in the end.  Though, it comes in waves and the trajectory is for the better, albeit slows

My question to you, how did you get into bioinformatics? Why did you get into bioinformatics? Why are you still doing it? What motivates you to pursue this instead of something else that could be more lucrative?

No wrong answers, just curious about your journey and how you feel about it now.

- I love molecular biology but hate working in a lab
- Majored in Biology in College. Chose biology because i loved animals and I wanted to study wild life. However, I ended up falling in love with molecular biology and biochemistry. Joined a biochem department for grad school, and joined a lab that studied gene expression. PI encouraged us to do our own bioinformatic analysis, so I did, and haven't looked back since. Taught myself how to do it all, and now I work as a bioinformatician analyzing bulk and single cell data.
I was always fond of computers, so the learning curve wasn't extremely steep lol but it did take me a couple of months to get used to the command line and R environments. 
I love the idea of taking advantage of computational power and discover what is happening in cells on a genome wide level. It's such a genius and unbiased way to look at cell states. It doesn't hurt that (at least in the US), bioinformatics get better salaries than strictly Mol or cell biologists lol
- Chose Biotech as my major and had one course on Bioinformatics and loved it. However I also loved other fields, and not going to lie, one of the reasons why I ultimately chose Bioinformatics it's because it's relatively easy to transition to Data Science/ML/SWE stuff, in case I ever get "tired" of bioinformatics or science in general
- I am really bad at the wet lab
- Started my career around 12 years ago. I only have a bachelors. 

I majored in biology and minored in compsci. Also got the ‘bioinformatics option for my undergrad. 

Right as I graduated I got an internship at a company doing image organization at a fluorescent imaging/microscopy company for their marketing department. Turned that into a contract doing software development for their software engineering team. 

 A person from that company left to join a startup at a company doing NGS for the clinic in it’s early days (hi-seq didn’t even exist, initial development was done on a GAII with the understanding the hi-seq was coming soon). 

At that startup I did a mix of IT, LIMS, Software engineering, and some work on the ngs pipeline. As time went on I moved more towards the ngs/bioinformatics work. 

These days I sell myself as someone who understands both science/software engineering/cloud architecture and target small startups where I can be 1 person covering several roles for places not big enough to justify multiple hires to specialize in them.
- Studied ecology for 11 years (BSc --> postdoc) out of passion. Picked up stats and programming out of necessity and got very good at them. Discovered that nobody, anywhere, is hiring ecologists. Followed the money to cancer bioinformatics and actually I'm into it. But I dream of returning to important (*ie* freshwater) science.
- For me bioinformatics is very [ikigai](https://www.hult.edu/blog/ikigai-find-purpose/) it’s something I’m good at, it’s something I can be paid for, it’s something that brings me some satisfaction, and it’s something the world needs/allows me to help people (cancer research)
- Entering ugrad I'd wanted to be an explorer naturalist or modern derivative -- something that would let me solve fun puzzles while spending lots of time outside. So I majored in biology & geology. However, it turned out that I *really* disliked fieldwork, finding that for me it represented the most obnoxious parts of all my outdoorsy hobbies, distilled into unpleasant drudgery (I'd always been a fairly avid outdoorsman, e.g. hiking / backpacking 10k+ / 2k+ km respectively).

So I went to grad school in anthropology, working primarily on Bayesian phylogenetics methods development, sprinkled with a bit of eg population / quantitative genetics. Had a lot of fun w/ coding & math, transitioning after to a postdoc in more generic comp bio. Part of that involved learning more about bioinformatics (one of my dept affiliations is "biomedical informatics"), so here I am, slowly learning more about the subfield!
- I've been fascinated with genetics/genomics since biology class freshman year of high school. I always yearned to be on the cutting edge of understanding, which led me into the wet lab. However, I quickly realized that without the ability to analyze your own data, you are not on the cutting edge. In addition, the freedom of being able to work from anywhere with a Wifi connection was extremely alluring. Lastly, the lab grew monotonous for me, and the active problem solving I experience in bioinformatics keeps me motivated and engaged, while enjoying my work.
- Going up through grade school and high school I always aced biology, chemistry, physics. I loved animals but one summer riding along with my horse's vet made me realize I would hate it. I've always been around computers, my parents met at Xerox PARC and got their first home computer in 1977. (TRS80) But I wasn't that interested in programming because computers were just the things boring old people came to my house to talk about with my parents.

First degree was in studio art and oil illustration. My favorite parts of the coursework were figuring out pigments, the physics of light and vision, but I was "limited" by my desire to simply accurately record the things I saw in front of me. (The program was very fine-art focused.) After that I worked in a company that made knock-off handbags and bridge jewelry adapting luxury couture to our price point. Hated it.

I went back to school to get my paramedic. The A&P coursework reignited my love of biology and I kind of knew I'd go back to school AGAIN eventually.

After working rural critical access and community mobile medicine gigs for awhile and getting severely burned out, I went back to school with the idea that I'd go into pure physics or math because I'd been good at them. I loved my Gen Chem course and so took an organic chemistry course because it was an acceptable elective for a physics major.

Loved ochem, so I took bio chem, loved it, took a molecular genetics course and whoopsie daisy I'm a biochem major now. I also took Pchem, instrumental analysis for my biochem electives, and did a lot PCR for undergrad research. I tried for a math minor, but the stats courses didn't count towards it so I just didn't apply for the minor. I also took discrete math, proofs, linear algebra sequences, probability theory, and vector calculus. Every math professor would ask "why are you here?" when I was the lone non-math/physics/CS student in their lecture. Generally the answer was that I'd read the wikipedia page on the field and thought it looked fun. Statistical Thermodynamics was REALLY awesome, because it was like the synthesis of all the random courses I'd been taking in biology, chemistry, math, and stats.

Then I took an intro to Python course because I needed some credits and it fit my schedule. Immediately I saw the application potential to enable my endless well of laziness and made a script to calculate the master mix recipe and ideal thermocycler algorithm for the 100s of PCR reactions I was doing every week. Then I made a script that would perform all the tedious standard error calculations for my instrumental analysis lab and also spit out LaTeX I could c&p in to my lab reports. Eventually that script also produced boilerplate methods sections that I just had to edit and spruce up a bit for my reports.

When I talked to the PI in the lab where I was doing my undergrad research towards the end of my senior year, I confessed I was worried because I just really, REALLY hated pipetting, and despite having worked in the lab for several years at that point was still clumsy and prone to breaking the glassware. I also had gotten a better look at exactly what being a PI was like (so many grants to pursue!) And also I knew I'd be miserable as a research associate/miserable and poor as an adjunct. I knew I was really bad at thinking up good problems to solve, but really good at untangling problems other people brought to me. I offhandedly mentioned my scripts I'd written to reduce the time I actually spent in the lab as evidence that maybe I wasn't cut out for science, my PI told me about this crazy field called "bioinformatics" that seemed to be right up my alley, and managed to touch on just about every subject my random walk through biology, chemistry, physics, and math had encountered.

In the first research lab where I did my internship and then was hired on as staff, I got to study the basis of some of the genetic diseases families I had cared for as a paramedic had. Now I'm working in a clinical environment, developing and maintaining NGS tools for pathologists and oncologists to use to diagnose and treat cancer and genetic diseases. My previous experience in direct patient care has served me very well here, and I love being able to be part of a healthcare team again.
- Started off in Cognitive Science. Always enjoyed computer science/programming and wanted to do something a bit different. Accidentally found the degree whilst looking for CompSci undergrads. Anyway turns out I don't really like Neuroscience/Psychology all that much (and although there was a lot of AI on our course it was taught poorly), but ended up doing two final year modules, one in bioinformatics and one in computational biology. Enjoyed them both a lot, got a 2:2 in my undegrad (doesn't matter now), but found a masters and got a distinction. Then pursued that project and more into a PhD, and just haven't stopped. Getting to a stage now though where I don't want to be a PI but 'perma-docing' may become difficult. Let's see!
- I love the computer science and programming aspects.  Enjoy the statistical thinking that comes along with data analysis.  And wanted to find a way to apply these things to a job where I can work on something that helps people (so much of data science in Tech is just trying to optimize ad-revenue instead).
- I ADMIRE the genetics science and programming, I can sit infront of the computer for days without complaining lol, and I hate wet lab SO MUCH.
- Bio major but I decided I don’t like being poor
- I liked analyzing data and working with data but also wanted to see a few womem every day. Biology companies have women in them.
- I'm from computer science myself, I started Bioinformatics from my undergrad thesis topic, I'm not really good at biology tbh, but it just seems not common and interesting at the time. 
From there I have continued in Bioinformatics with the same supervisor for the master and there's a lot to explore, our projects were mainly focused on drug repurposing from computational method. 
Now I'm continuing in PhD, still in drug repurposing but from different point of view. Still have so much I need to learn.
- I loved science and nature since my childhood, as I was good at maths too, I did a Biochem Eng. undergrad. In college, I found how we can use computers to understand biology by doing peptide structure simulations, then I change my path to Bioinformatics.
- In undergrad I set out for biology, had lots of fun with ecology and plant physiology, which turned into evolutionary genetics, and then bioinformatics. Spent a while working for a state agency doing research/scientific monitoring and felt I wasn’t scratching the itch, and now I’m in a biomedical informatics program studying fungi! Turns out that I really live the “puzzle solving” feeling of writing code
- My first post-undergrad wet lab job was $35k/yr. My first bioinformatics job is $88k/yr. I graduate with my MS Bioinformatics in Dec.
- I primarily want to join to to be able to handle big data.
