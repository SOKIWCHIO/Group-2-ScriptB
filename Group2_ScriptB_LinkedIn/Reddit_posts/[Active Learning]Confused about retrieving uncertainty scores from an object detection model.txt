Title: [Active Learning]Confused about retrieving uncertainty scores from an object detection model

Content:
Hello, I have been trying to figure out how to retrieve informativeness or uncertainty scores from images in an object detection model. 

Getting a uncertainty score from an image in classification model is relatively straight forward, but i'm confused about getting the score from an object detection model. 

The most straightforward way seems to be training a separate classification model on cropped images of objects from a object detection model and average the uncertainty scores in an image depending on the number of object in the picture. 

But this seems like a lot of work and I was wondering if I could somehow derive these scores within the object detection model without training a separate classification model. 

thanks in advance.

Comments:
- The object detection model likely has the "scores"/"objectness" in the part of the architecture that's just before label assignment.
- Two stage methods typically have objectness scores for the proposal and a classification score generated by processing the ROI in the second stage.  E.g. Faster RCNN already does what you're suggesting.

Single stage methods also provide scores for each detection.  The basic single stage methods predict a classification score and a bounding box.  

Some recent methods combine classification and iou predictions into a single score, e.g. VarifocalNet.

One issue to keep in mind is while the output of the model may exist from 0-1 for most methods these are not carefully calibrated probabilistic values.  The relationship between precision and recall and the predicted score varies between different methods.
