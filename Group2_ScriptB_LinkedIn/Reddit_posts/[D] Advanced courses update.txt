Title: [D] Advanced courses update

Content:
EDIT Jan 2021 : I am still updating the list as of Jan, 2021 and will most probably continue to do so for foreseeable future. So, please feel free to message me any courses you find interesting that fit here.

We have a [PhD level or Advanced courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/51qhc8/phdlevel_courses/) thread in the sidebar but it's three year old now. There were two other 7-8 month old threads ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cae59l/d_advanced_courses_update/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cjnund/d_what_are_your_favorite_videos_lectures_on/)) but they don't have many quality responses either. 

So, can we have a new one here?

To reiterate - CS231n, CS229, ones from Udemy etc are not advanced. 

Advanced ML/DL/RL, attempts at building theory of DL, optimization theory, advanced applications etc are some examples of what I believe should belong here, much like the original sidebar post.

You can also suggest (new) categories for the courses you share. :)

Edit: Upon suggestion, categorized the courses. There might be some misclassifications as I'm not trained on this task ;). Added some good ones from older (linked above) discussions.

Comments:
- [Learning Discrete Latent Structure](https://duvenaud.github.io/learn-discrete/)
- PhD-level course  [EP3260: Fundamentals of Machine Learning Over Networks](https://sites.google.com/view/mlons/home)
- [CS 287: Advanced Robotics, Fall 2019](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa19/) with Pieter Abbeel is great! It covers a lot of stuff: basic RL, control theory, motion planning, particle filtering, all the way up to state-of-the-art RL algorithms for robotics.
- CMU 11-747 (Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing) should definitely go in as it's more advanced than CS224n and is also a high-quality course.
http://phontron.com/class/nn4nlp2020
- CMU's [Probablistic Graphical Models](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCim-E6bNz7lUyKZwhgN6S1A/featured) by Professor Eric Xing.
- [CS 330: Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning](https://cs330.stanford.edu/)
- https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp20/home
- I am taking an Advanced NLP course 6.864 
at MIT right now.  We donât have videos yet, but Iâll post here when/if we do,
- Could anyone recommend a good course on Speech processing?
- Yes. That makes sense. If there a thread for intermediate level courses, it should be added there. I think [CMU 36-702](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTB9VQq8WiaCBK2XrtYn5t9uuPdsNm7YE) is advanced enough for this list though
- Deep RL:

[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFD6\_40KJIwhWJpGazJ9VSj9CFMkb79A](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFD6_40KJIwhWJpGazJ9VSj9CFMkb79A)
- [CS224W](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) is a good one for ML on graphs.
- Another statistical learning theory (taught by PhD from Stanford, now prof at U of T):

[Statistical Learning Theory] (https://erdogdu.github.io/csc2532/)
- How about this?

[https://github.com/avehtari/BDA\_course\_Aalto](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto)

For me, it's like a hidden gem :-)
- Topics in Robust and Deployable ML (6.S979) has a variety of slides and notes but no assignments.

https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/6.S979/
- Would you consider [CS224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)  an advanced course?
- Anybody have any suggestions for courses on theory or application of recommendation systems?
- Perhaps Emma Brunskill's [CS 234](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234).
- Advanced PhD-level topics course, notes (180pg), + presentations:  [https://github.com/dobriban/Topics-in-deep-learning](https://github.com/dobriban/Topics-in-deep-learning) 

Covers advanced topics such as adversarial examples, fairness, graph NNs, modern theory (e.g., neural tangent kernels), applications to chemistry, visual Q+A, etc.
- Anyone knows about any courses on time series forecasting using ML or DL?
