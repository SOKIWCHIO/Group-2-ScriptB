Title: [D] Capturing forecast uncertainty for a SVR model

Content:
Does anybody have any suggestions to quantify forecast uncertainty for an SVR model?

In parametric models such as basic OLS - forecast intervals accounting for both parameter and observational uncertainty is fairly straightforward. Similarly with a neural network - uncertainty can be quantified by adding dropout layers and modelling the distribution of predictions - however I'm not entirely sure how best to do this using an SVR!

Any ideas greatly welcome

Comments:
- You can do a bootstrap to estimate the model uncertainty (epistemic part) and add the noise to that (estimated from the RSS).
