Title: [D] Completed Amazon ML Summer School 2025 curious who else attended?

Content:
Hey everyone,  
I just completedÂ **Amazon ML Summer School 2025**Â ðŸŽ‰  
It was a month-long program covering a solid range of ML topicsÂ ***supervised/unsupervised learning, deep neural nets, generative AI & LLMs, RL, and even causal inference***.  
The sessions were intense but super rewarding. I feel like this experience gave me a strong foundation to explore advanced AI research and projects.

Curious if anyone here has also attended and how you re planning to apply what you learned?
