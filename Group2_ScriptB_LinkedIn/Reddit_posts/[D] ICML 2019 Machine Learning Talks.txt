I thought I would put together a list of the machine learning talks from ICML 2019 since I found they were kind of difficult to look through on facebook, and I figured I would share it here. There may be some minor errors in the listing also. I believe they are mostly available on the ICML website too, but I was just looking through the livestreams: https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/Videos . I already posted some of these over on /r/reinforcementlearning as well.

Comments:
- Though I understand that it might've always been like this with research in many fields but looking at this huge list of talks induces an anxiety in me because just in this list, I found a lot of new or updates on stuff I'm interested in and it just feels like a mere human like myself will never be able to catch up. 
Also, thanks for sharing this.
- facebook is absolutely awful for these video talks. I wonder by default why they do not end up on youtube. I am guessing there is a sponsorship clause involved.
- The effort is neat, but these are on slideslive, and it's a much better interface: https://slideslive.com/t/icml-2019
- Thank you for organizing this.

- I always feel the same way. Not quite sure how to deal with that feeling

The pdf files are here, for those of us without facebook desires.

- That was nice. Thank you.
