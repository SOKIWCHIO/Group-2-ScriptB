Comments:
- This book is really good
- Yep, I'm this old. Still have a copy lying around from my undergrad days.
- Still foundational to understanding
- Everyone should read this book, it's really good for fundamentals
- Yes it is a great book. 

My wife reminded me the other day that I spent a lot of money back in the lat late 1980s buying the first edition of the Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence. 

Parallel Distributed Processing by Rumelbardt et al was a very good read too around that time. 

It has been a long hard road to get to where we are not and IMHO we are still 2-3 breakthroughs away from superintelligence.
- I defended 11 years ago and I'm pretty sure that quote is in my manuscript.
- Started out similarly a few years back in undergrad but with Staurt Russel & Peter Norvigâ€™s book, Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach.
- Prof. Mitchellâ€™s book is still a classic. Itâ€™s foundational. Fantastic teacher and startup adviser.
- this is legent back to my 20s, 15 years ago!
- That was a good line tho I am not that old ðŸ˜‚ I started doing ml recently
- That's an insanely good book which is still a great introductory read today.
- Ha, this book was actually fun and goos
- Yep
- Itâ€™s actually the textbook for ML at Georgia Tech
- The book itself is old but was still taught when I was in uni, which was only... wait...
- Its a great resource tbh. Had this quote on my bsc thesis and that was like 2 years ago
- Don't have the book but remember this from the Andrew Ng Stanford MooC.
- Classics are classics for a reason.
- Chapter 2 should be required reading for any intro ML course
- I defended 3 years ago and that quote is also in my manuscript. It is just a good starting point if nothing else.
