Title: [D] Looking for a self-hosted alternative to Modal.com for running ML workloads

Content:
Hey folks 



I've been using [Modal.com](http://Modal.com) (I am not affiliated) for a while to run machine learning workloads in the cloud, and I really like its simplicity, container-based execution, and ability to scale on demand. However, I'm starting to explore more self-hosted options due to cost reasons and to gain more control over the infrastructure while building apps.



Does anyone know of good self-hosted alternatives that offer similar functionality? Ideally, something that:



\- Supports containerized jobs (Docker or similar)

\- Can run Python/ML workloads easily

\- Has a nice API  for launching jobs (this is important) 

\- Offers some kind of job orchestration or scheduling

\- Bonus: GPU support and autoscaling would be amazing





Thanks in advance 



Comments:
- Kubernetes on premises with plugins like OpenFaaS or Apache Airflow can provide similar scalability and containerization, with Python and ML support.
- [Beam](https://beam.cloud) is the top open-source alternative to Modal (I'm the founder). You can self-host or connect your own hardware. If you're only looking for orchestration of GPUs \[and open to writing a bit of YAML\], I'd look into [Skypilot](https://skypilot.co/).
- Thanks, I will take a look and appreciate it, but not a huge fan of running my own K8S cluster for prod (it's fun for non prod tho, but too much work)
- Thanks, I will take a look and appreciate it!
