Content:
Paper with Code was being spammed (https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lkedb8/d\_paperswithcode\_has\_been\_compromised/) before, and now it is compoletely down. It was also down a coupld times before, but seems like this time it has lasted for days. (https://github.com/paperswithcode/paperswithcode-data/issues)



Comments:
- Is there anything we can do to help these people?
- Who owns paperswithcode? Both of the major contributors I could find appear to be very inactive
- ugh it is still down -- it's been really unstable lately. What have you all been using as resources instead?

- its down today
- It's fluctuating between Up and down.

I am facing the same issue
- Even if it is up, I still can't log in to my account, and I need to log in to modify the relevant information of the article.
