Title: [D] Recommended preparation material for ML interviews.

Content:
Hi everyone,

Below I am gathering some interview preparation tools for ML research positions. People who had been in the job market recently, which one would you recommend/ find more relevant? Any other resources that I might be missing?

(1) InterviewQuery:

Comments:
- Thank you for sharing! I interviewed last year and felt very underprepared, this will definitely help for my next round!
- That stuff all looks good, last time I was applying there were a bunch of great resources on YouTube for practice interviews and such. The questions change so often a lot of it is probably out dated, but definitely worth looking into.
- [Deep Learning Interviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00650v2) ([previously posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/qbwgvy/the_pdf_version_of_my_book_deep_learning/)) is free on ArXiv, but the current iteration is aimed more at optimization and network design, rather than specific applications - are you aiming at any specific subfields (e.g. computer vision, LLMs etc.)?
- Thanks for your reply! As far as you remember, which one do you think is closest to the real thing?
- thanks! so you think all of them are on par in terms of relevance (as far as you remember)?
- I interviewed for 2 FAANG research science internships, and imo (at first glance) the AIOfferly questions seem most relevant! Might be different for different roles/levels though.
- The ones you listed? First glance yes, I’ll probably have to look again in more detail if you want rankings, I’ll respond again later
- I see. AIOfferly seems more focused on NLP questions perhaps this is why.

 thanks a lot!
- yeap for the ones I listed!

"First glance yes, I’ll probably have to look again in more detail if you want rankings, I’ll respond again later"  
wow I think this would help a lot!
