Title: [D] Working on a ML in Quant Finance Conf - Need your guidance

Content:
Hellow ML/Al folks,

I'm working on an upcoming Machine Learning in Quantitative Finance conference, my role is to outreach and engage relevant professionals.

While I've handled other events before, this field is new to me. I'd appreciate any quick tips, resources, or key concepts to get up to speed.

Also, if you have advice on how to approach senior roles (MDs, Heads of Departments, Chiefs, Presidents) effectively in this space.

Thanks
