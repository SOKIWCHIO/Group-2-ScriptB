Excited to announce our upcoming live, hands-on workshop:"**Real-time Video Analytics with Nvidia DeepStream and Python**"

CCTV setups are everywhere, providing live video feeds 24/7. However, most systems only capture video‚Äîthey don‚Äôt truly understand what‚Äôs happening in it. Building a computer vision system that interprets video content can enable real-time alerts and actionable insights.

Nvidia‚Äôs DeepStream, built on top of GStreamer, is a flagship software which can process multiple camera streams in real time and run deep learning models on each stream in parallel. Optimized for Nvidia GPUs using TensorRT, it‚Äôs a powerful tool for developing video analytics applications.

In this hands-on online workshop, you will learn:

1. The fundamentals of DeepStream
2. How to build a working DeepStream pipeline
3. How to run multiple deep learning models on each stream (object detection, image classification, object tracking)
4. How to handle file input/output and process live RTSP/RTMP streams
5. How to develop a real-world application with DeepStream (Real-time Entry/Exit Counter)

Comments:
- Is there a recording of the event?
- Unfortunately, we did not record this workshop. Sorry about that. We are planning to record the workshops from this week (we are conducting hands-on workshops every week).

But I can share the materials used in the session and add you to an exclusive discord server where you can post your questions if you face any issues.
- Would that be useful ?
