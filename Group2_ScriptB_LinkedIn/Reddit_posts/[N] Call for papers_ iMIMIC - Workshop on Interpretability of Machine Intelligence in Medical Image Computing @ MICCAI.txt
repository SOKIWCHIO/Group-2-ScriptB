Title: [N] Call for papers: iMIMIC - Workshop on Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in Medical Image Computing @ MICCAI

Content:
We would like to invite you to submit your contributions to the Workshop on Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in Medical Image  Computing ([iMIMIC](https://imimic.bitbucket.io/)) at the 2018 [MICCAI](https://www.miccai2018.org) conference in Granada.

iMIMIC is a half-day workshop to be held on September 16th, 2018. The program features two excellent keynote speakers as well as oral presentations from selected paper contributions.

This workshop aims at introducing the challenges and opportunities related to the topic of interpretability of ML systems in the context of Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention.

There will be a regular paper track (8 pages LNCS format). We intend to join the MICCAI Satellite Events joint proceedings published in LNCS. We encourage participants to submit their exploratory research work. Covered topics include but are not limited to:

- Definition of interpretability in context of medical image analysis.
- Visualization techniques useful for model interpretation in medical image analysis.
- Local explanations for model interpretability in medical image analysis.
- Methods to improve transparency of machine learning models commonly used in medical image analysis
- Textual explanations of model decisions in medical image analysis.
- Uncertainty quantification in context of model interpretability.
- Quantification and measurement of interpretability.
- Legal and regulatory aspects of model interpretability in medicine.
