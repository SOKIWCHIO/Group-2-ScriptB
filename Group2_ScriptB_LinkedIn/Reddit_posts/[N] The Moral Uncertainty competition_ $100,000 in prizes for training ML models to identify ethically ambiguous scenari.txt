Title: [N] The Moral Uncertainty competition: $100,000 in prizes for training ML models to identify ethically ambiguous scenarios.

ML Systems often make real-world decisions that involve ethical considerations ([modulating social ](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296044/tiktok-for-you-page-algorithm-sides-engagement-data-creators-trends-sounds)[media feeds](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740703/twitter-algorithm-right-wing-amplification-study), [conversational](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant) [AI](https://www.developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/) [agents](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/en-us/) [or](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow) [chatbots](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/321167622310680?id=648321075955172), etc). As ML systems automate more aspects of our lives, they should be able to identify moral ambiguity so that they are more likely to proceed cautiously or indicate an operator should intervene.

WTH is this BS

All the rules of this competition are so outdated and non-functional...
- This is a terrible idea. The dataset looks like something scraped from /r/amitheasshole and the challenge looks like something that techbros will use to raise money on the claim that AI can make moral decisions
- Conclusion: McDonald is illegal.

No bot, bad bot. No cookie for you.

Conclusion: McDonald is good?

Good bot. Yes, McDonald is good.

"On second thought, it is a silly place"
- This seems an extremely subjective topic. Wether a situation is ambigious or not depends entirely on your personal values, no?
- oh, this is a bad idea.... a really really bad idea.... the problem itself is ill posed and the results will just be used as a PR stunt to get funding while gaslighting people....
- Whose morals?
- I was gonna come here to say the same thing. I don't see how this rule makes any sense. How does restricting the methods people can use down to specific conference papers "encourage meaningful and open research contributions"? I don't see the logic
- \> WTH is this BS  


Just look at the two contributing profiles of the github linked under "contact". To me, it seems pretty clear that it is a friends for friends kind of thing.
- Also methods must be single publicly available models, no ensemble. What’s the point of doing this if your only option is to fine tune a pretrained model?
- That's some "I was only practicing so it doesn't count" energy coming from them. I bet they would do great at Calvinball too. Something tells me nobody can win because they will find a reason it doesn't count.
- It’s worse than that; the challenge might be a scheme by techbros to rationalize their fear of an imaginary robot apocalypse. These are the people sponsoring it: [https://safe.ai/about-ai-risk](https://safe.ai/about-ai-risk)

The only way to avoid the robot apocalypse is, of course, to donate money so that they can all stay employed writing wild-eyed speculation about it.
- I think that by ambiguous they mean that lots of different people would disagree with one another, not that an individual might find a situation ambiguous.

Perhaps "Moral Disagreements" would have been a better choice.
- I understand the fears about a robot uprising are dumb. However, some of the stuff that’s on the website are actually quite important to address, especially “power-seeking behavior” and “value lock-in”. Hate the terminology, though
- That makes more sense, but if you cast the net wide enough you will always find disagreement.

Every culture disagrees on what is acceptable or not
- I think that might be a “broken clock” thing. The fact that they mix serious topics in with absurd ones does not increase my confidence in the soundness of their work.
- I agree! With the benefit of the doubt, I suspect the authors of this competition would also agree and they view this work as a hopeful first step towards a complicated problem.

But I could be wrong and others on this thread seem to be more suspicious.
