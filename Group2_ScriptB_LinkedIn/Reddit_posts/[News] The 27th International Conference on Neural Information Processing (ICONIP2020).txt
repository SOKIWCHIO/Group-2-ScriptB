\# Paper Information  
Papers should be written in English and follow the Springer LNCS format. Paper submissions are single-blind review, so author names can be shown in the submission. The submission of a paper implies that the paper is original and has not been submitted under review or is not copyright-protected elsewhere and will be presented by an author if accepted. All submitted papers will be refereed by experts in the field based on the criteria of originality, significance, quality, and clarity.  


The Proceedings will be published in the Springer’s series of Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Selected papers will be reviewed and published in some special issues of SCI journals.  


Final papers after acceptance will normally be 10 pages with a maximum of 12 pages in length. The page count includes everything, including references and appendices. Please follow Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates provided in Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WuA4JS5uZpi).
