Hey, there, 

We ([Eto.ai](https://Eto.ai)) are building an open-source unstructured ML data (image, video, sensor) framework, called [Rikai](https://github.com/eto-ai/rikai), which features:

* SQL-ML capability (Bring your own model, BYOM)
   * Support Pytorch / Tensorflow / Sklearn model inference via SQL
   * Large scale feature engineering and GPU inference via Spark SQL backend
* Native tensor / numpy SerDe in the dataset
   * Native Pytorch / Tensorflow / Pandas readers
* Semantic types for CV tasks
   * 2d/3d bounding box, segmentations and etc
* Jupyter integration for visualization and JDBC integration
   * Semantic types (Image, Video, Bounding box) can be directly rendered in Jupyter notebooks
   * Use Looker / Mode Analytics to visualize the stats of your image and sensor dataset (via JDBC)

The goal of this project is to empower everyone to analyze machine learning data at scale.

Here is a demo: [Active Learning Simplified with Rikai](https://blog.eto.ai/active-learning-made-simple-c274f5d053e) . It demonstrates how ***simple*** it is to use uncertainty sampling to achieve equivalent model accuracy while significantly reducing labeling cost.
