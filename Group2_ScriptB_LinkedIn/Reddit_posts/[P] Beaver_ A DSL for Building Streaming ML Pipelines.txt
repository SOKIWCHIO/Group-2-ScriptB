Title: [P] Beaver: A DSL for Building Streaming ML Pipelines

Content:
Hi guys!

My name is Jason I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student and for the last year I have been working on my thesis, in which I have developed Beaver – a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to make building machine learning pipelines for streaming data (e.g., Kafka) much simpler and more accessible.

What is Beaver?

* A DSL that lets you define ML pipelines using a clear, declarative syntax (instead of complex Python code)
* Generates Python code that integrates with the [River](http://riverml.xyz/latest/) library for online ML and supports real-time data streams
* Includes built-in validation, analysis, and automatic dashboard generation

  
I'm making this post to ask for some feedback. I’ve prepared a user testing experience with 3 tasks (from basic to advanced) that should take about 30-45 minutes. I’d love to hear your thoughts on usability, clarity, and the overall concept.

* 📖 [Concept overview & docs](http://deepblue597.github.io/beaver-doc/)
* 📝 [User testing instructions](https://github.com/deepblue597/beaver/blob/user_testing/user_testing.md)
* 🦫 [Example pipeline file](https://github.com/deepblue597/beaver/blob/user_testing/examples/linear.bvr)
* 💬 [Feedback form](https://forms.gle/ioLVyvruJ2KCs6wd8)

Repo : [https://github.com/deepblue597/beaver](https://github.com/deepblue597/beaver)  
It is recommended to use the user\_testing branch for the feedback.   
  
Thank you so much for your time <3
