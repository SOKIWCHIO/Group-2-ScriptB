Title: [P] Chromatic Language Models (CLM): A Paradigm for Native Visual Communication in Artificial Intelligence

**Abstract**

[**https://zenodo.org/records/15769766**](https://zenodo.org/records/15769766)

Modern AI models, in particular Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer Vision models, operate in fundamentally distinct data domains: text and pixels. The interaction between these models requires expensive and complex translation and embedding processes. This work introduces a new paradigm,  **Chromatic Language Models (CLMs)** , designed to eliminate this discontinuity. Building on the principles of visual semantic coding established in  **Usai ColorZip**  (Usai, 2025a) and validated by the  **Usai ChromoChess** application  (Usai, 2025b), CLMs are language models that operate natively on a chromatic domain. We propose an encoder-decoder architecture in which an AI agent learns to "read" and "write" complex information directly as images, treating pixels as semantic tokens. This approach not only unifies language and vision, but creates an intrinsically compressed, secure, and efficient form of AI-native communication, paving the way for a new generation of multimodal intelligent agents.

**1. Introduction**

The evolution of artificial intelligence is characterized by increasing specialization. On the one hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human language. On the other hand, computer vision models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), excel at interpreting visual data. However, a fundamental "modal gap" separates these two worlds. An LLM does not "see" images and a ViT does not "read" text; both rely on intermediate embedding layers to translate information from one domain to the other.

This paper addresses a radical question: what if we could close this gap by transforming language itself into a natively visual format? Instead of teaching a model to translate between text and pixels, could we create a model that "thinks" directly in pixels?

We propose the architecture of  **Chromatic Language Models (CLM)** , intelligent agents that use a chromatic representation of language for each stage of their cognitive process: input, reasoning, and output. This proposal builds directly on the technological and conceptual foundations of our previous work, which demonstrated the feasibility of such a representation.

**2. Fundamental Works and Context**

Our proposal is not born in a vacuum, but is the natural evolution of two previous researches that established the feasibility of visual semantic coding.

**2.1. Usai ColorZip: Semantic Text Encoding**  
In our work "Usai ColorZip: A Hybrid System for Semantic Text Encoding and Compression via HTML Colors" (Usai, 2025a), we introduced a lossless system for mapping lexical units (words) to unique color codes. We demonstrated that this transformation is not only an act of encoding, but also an effective data compression mechanism when combined with lossless image formats such as PNG. The key to the system is its hybrid architecture, capable of handling both a large dictionary of known words and any unknown word via a color escape protocol.  **Usai ColorZip created the "vocabulary" and "syntax" of this new language.**

**2.2. Usai ChromoChess: Proof of Concept in a Complex Domain**  
Later, in "Usai ChromoChess: Visual Representation and Compression of Chess Games" (Usai, 2025b), we applied this philosophy to a formal and complex domain. By transforming chess games from PGN notation to 8x8 pixel movies, we demonstrated that a sequence of logical states can be represented as a visual data stream, compact and ideal for analysis by vision models.  **Usai ChromoChess provided proof that entire logical-temporal processes can be efficiently encoded in this chromatic language.**

These two works constitute the necessary prerequisite for the next step: no longer just encoding and decoding data, but creating an intelligence that  *uses*  this language as its primary means of communication and reasoning.

**3. Architecture of the Chromatic Language Model (CLM)**

A CLM is an AI model designed for an end-to-end communication cycle in the color domain. Its architecture is based on an encoder-decoder model.

**3.1. The Principle: Visual Tokenization**  
The fundamental unit of a CLM is not a word or subword, but a  **colored pixel** . Each color, defined in the ColorZip dictionary, is a discrete semantic token. An input "text" (e.g. a question) is provided to the model as a ColorZip image (a tensor \[H x W x C\], where H, W are the dimensions and C is the RGB representation of the color).

**3.2. The Encoder: The Chromatic Reader**  
The encoder has the task of "reading" the input image and understanding its meaning. An ideal architecture for this purpose is a  **Vision Transformer (ViT)** .

1. The ColorZip image is divided into a grid of patches (which can correspond to single pixels/words or small groups).
2. These patches are projected into a vector space and processed through self-attention mechanisms.
3. The encoder's output is a context vector (or sequence of vectors), an abstract, latent mathematical representation of the semantic meaning of the input image.

**\[Figure 1: Encoder-Decoder architecture of a CLM. The Encoder (ViT) processes the input image. Its semantic output conditions the Decoder (Transformer), which generates a new image pixel by pixel (color by color).\]**

**3.3. The Decoder: The Color Writer**  
The decoder has the task of taking the context vector and generating a response, also in the form of a ColorZip image.

1. A standard Transformer architecture is used as the decoder.
2. The process is autoregressive: the model generates one pixel (color) at a time.
3. The crucial difference lies in its output layer: instead of softmaxing a vocabulary of tens of thousands of words, CLM softmaxes  **the color dictionary** . The model predicts the most likely color for the next pixel, given its understanding of the query and the colors generated so far.
4. The process ends when the model generates the special color EOT\_COLOR defined in Usai ColorZip.

**4. Implications: Towards AI-Native Communication**

The adoption of CLMs does not represent an incremental improvement, but a paradigm shift with profound implications.

* **Computational Efficiency:**  The overhead of constant conversion between text and numeric representations is eliminated. AI operates on a data format that is closer to its mathematical nature.
* **Secure and Compressed Communication:**  Conversations between CLM agents would be opaque images to an unauthorized observer (without the dictionary) and, as demonstrated by Usai ColorZip, highly compressed. This is ideal for low-bandwidth or stealth communications.
* **True Multimodality:**  A CLM that "speaks" the language of pixels is intrinsically closer to understanding real images. The boundary between language and vision becomes blurry, facilitating the creation of truly multimodal models capable of reasoning fluidly about text and images without internal barriers.
* **New Application Scenarios:**  Possibilities open up for AI agents that communicate steganographically through image sharing platforms, or for the development of specialized hardware (color processors) optimized for these data flows.

**5. Challenges and Future Work**

The road to fully functional CLMs presents several challenges: creating large-scale training datasets (text corpora parallel to their ColorZip representations), analyzing their computational costs compared to traditional LLMs, and exploring the interpretability of these models. Future work will focus on developing a prototype CLM and training it on a medium-sized corpus to empirically validate its ability to "converse" chromatically.

**6. Conclusion**

This paper introduced Chromatic Language Models (CLMs), a new type of intelligent agent that reads, reasons, and writes directly in a color-based visual language. Building on the solid foundation of  **Usai ColorZip** semantic coding  and the application validation of  **Usai ChromoChess** , we outlined a viable architecture that unifies the domains of language and vision. CLMs are not simply a new model, but a proposal for a  **new form of AI-native communication** : a language for machines, spoken by machines.
