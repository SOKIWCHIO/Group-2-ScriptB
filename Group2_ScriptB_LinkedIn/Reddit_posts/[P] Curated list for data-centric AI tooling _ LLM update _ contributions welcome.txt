Title: [P] Curated list for data-centric AI tooling / LLM update / contributions welcome

Content:
The tooling space for LLMs and RAG is evolving fast. We updated our â€œAwesome Open Data Centric AI" list to reflect that: [https://github.com/Renumics/awesome-open-data-centric-ai](https://github.com/Renumics/awesome-open-data-centric-ai)

Unsurprisingly, the biggest changes are in the "Security" and the "Observability" category.

Also, it is great to see that an increasing amount of tools revolve around qualitative data understanding (instead of quantiative metrics) and data curation.
