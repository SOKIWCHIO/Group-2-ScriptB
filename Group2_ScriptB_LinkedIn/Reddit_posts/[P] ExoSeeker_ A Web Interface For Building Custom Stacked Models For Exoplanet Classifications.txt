Title: [P] ExoSeeker: A Web Interface For Building Custom Stacked Models For Exoplanet Classifications

Content:
Hi everyone! I just want to share ExoSeeker, a machine learning web interface, I created for the NASA Space Apps Challenge this year. It allows anyone to upload data of potential exoplanets, planets outside the Solar System, from the Kelper mission, a space telescope designed to hunt for Earth-sized planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way, and train a custom machine learning model, select classifiers and tweak their main hyperparameters, on it. 

You can freely build their own model by selecting from multiple estimators (random forest, gradient boosting, and multi-layer perceptron) and adjust each one's primary hyperparameters. After model training, you upload a new dataset without the exoplanet disposition, with only the feature to run predictions on it using the saved model.
