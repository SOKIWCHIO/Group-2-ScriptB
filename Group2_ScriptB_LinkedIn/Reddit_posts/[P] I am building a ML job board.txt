Title: [P] I am building a ML job board

Content:
Hey fellow ML people!

Last year, I shared with you a job board for [FAANG positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ia7feh/p_made_a_faang_job_postings_aggregator_for_ai/) and due to the positive feedback I received, I had been working on expanded version called [hire.watch](https://hire.watch/?categories=AI+_+Machine+Learning)

The goal is provide a unified search experience - it crawls, cleans and extracts data, allowing filtering by:

1. Full-text search
2. Location - on-site
3. Remote - from a given city, US state, EU, etc.
4. Category - you can check out the machine learning category here: [https://hire.watch/?categories=AI+\_+Machine+Learning](https://hire.watch/?categories=AI+_+Machine+Learning)
5. Years of experience and seniority
6. Target gross salary
7. Date posted and date modified

I used the normal ML ecosystem (scikit learn, huggingface transformers, LLMs, etc.) to build it, and Plotly Dash for the UI.

Let me know what you think - feel free to ask questions and request features :)

Comments:
- I checked the website and it functions well so good job!
Maybe in the future you can add a AI resume checker (could be a gpt wrapper or a fine-tuned one) that recommends jobs based upon your resume content.
- It's a good idea - probably will do it in the future :)
