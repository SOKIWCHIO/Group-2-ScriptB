Looking to interview people who’ve worked on audio labeling for ML (PhD research project)

Hi everyone,
I’m a PhD candidate in Communication researching modern sound technologies. My dissertation is a cultural history of audio datasets used in machine learning: I’m interested in how sound is conceptualized, categorized, and organized within computational systems.
I’m currently looking to speak with people who have done audio labeling or annotation work for ML projects (academic, industry, or open-source). These interviews are part of an oral history component of my research.
Specifically, I’d love to hear about:
- how particular sound categories were developed or negotiated,
- how disagreements around classification were handled, and
- how teams decided what counted as a “good” or “usable” data point.
If you’ve been involved in building, maintaining, or labeling sound datasets - from environmental sounds to event ontologies - I’d be very grateful to talk. Conversations are confidential, and I can share more details about the project and consent process if you’re interested.
You can DM me here
Thanks so much for your time and for all the work that goes into shaping this fascinating field.

Comments:
- I was the lead on a large darpa program that involved acoustic classification.
- DMd you
