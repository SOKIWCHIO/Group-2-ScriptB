Title: [P] Need to train a model that can detect which 2D image a smartphone camera is looking at (out of about 1000).

Content:
Hey everyone. I'm an AR developer and studio owner, I'm looking for someone to help us with a client project that requires training a machine learning model. Specifically I want a model that can tell me which pin (out of about 1000) a smartphone camera is looking at. Assuming there is only one pin in view, and it's fairly close to the camera. I don't need to find it's location in the image, just need to know which pin I'm looking at. 

Here is a sample of a few pins:

They are all more or less that size. I would love some direction and even training code, happy to pay for your time. DM me for more info.

Comments:
- This sounds like a fairly simple problem if you have the design of all pins and/or can take pictures of all of them
- Seems like this could be solved with some sort of template matching instead of ML/DL?
- You could try fine-tuning a pre-trained ImageNet CNN. There's probably better options now but that's where I would start
- so the question is which pin out of the 6 pins in your sample image is the camera looking at? what does the ground truth look like for this sample?

or if its more like identifying out of 1000 pins, what pins are shown in a picture, that sounds way easier to do with object detection + classification.
- Maybe but depending on the specifics you might not even need DL.
- If it's the first, I think it's a pretty bad problem statement. The only way you could formalize which pin the camera is looking at would be some form of centrality measure of a pin wrt to the complete image.
