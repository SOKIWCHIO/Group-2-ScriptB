OSS Released **MAPLE – a Multi Agent Protocol Language Engine** designed for fast, secure, and reliable agent communication.

— a new **open-source protocol** designed for **multi-agent communication** at **production scale**.

**MAPLE** offers features we haven't seen in other protocols:

🔧 **Integrated Resource Management:** The **ONLY** protocol with built-in resource specification, negotiation, and optimization

🛡️ **Link Identification Mechanism (LIM):** Revolutionary security through verified communication channels

⚡ **Result<T,E> Type System:** ELIMINATES all silent failures and communication errors

🌐 **Distributed State Synchronization:** Sophisticated **state management** across agent networks

🏭 **Production-Grade Performance:** **Very high** **performance** for a **feature-rich** protocol with **sub-millisecond** latency

💻 **pip install maple-oss**

PyPI here: [https://pypi.org/project/maple-oss/](https://pypi.org/project/maple-oss/)

If you’re building with agents or need robust, real-world communication between systems,  
check out **MAPLE GitHub** repo: [https://github.com/maheshvaikri-code/maple-oss](https://github.com/maheshvaikri-code/maple-oss)

Please try and test it with your projects.
