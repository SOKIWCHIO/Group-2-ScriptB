Title: [P] SDLArch-RL: Multi-Console Gaming Environment for Reinforcement Learning Research

Content:
Hey r/MachineLearning! I've been working on addressing a persistent pain point in RL gaming research - the setup complexity and limited scope of training environments.

**SDLArch-RL** is a unified RL environment that integrates multiple console emulators (N64, PS2, Dreamcast, GameCube) with standard ML frameworks. Key technical features:

* **Gymnasium-compliant interface** \- drop-in replacement for existing workflows
* **Stable-Baselines3 integration** \- works out-of-the-box with PPO, SAC, TD3, etc.
* **Efficient state management** \- leverages native emulator save states for fast episode resets
* **Configurable observation spaces** \- raw pixels, processed features, or memory states
* **Action space mapping** \- handles complex controller inputs to discrete/continuous actions

Currently supports 4 emulator backends with plans for modern console integration (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U). The environment abstracts away emulator-specific APIs while preserving access to low-level features when needed.

**Technical implementation highlights:**

* SDL-based architecture for minimal overhead
* Memory mapping support for game-specific feature extraction
* Reproducible training through deterministic save state handling
* Multi-game training capabilities within single environment instance

This opens up training on thousands of diverse games vs. the typical handful of custom environments. Particularly useful for transfer learning studies, multi-task RL, and curriculum learning research.

Happy to discuss technical details or answer implementation questions. Thoughts on potential research applications?
