Title: [P] UQLM: Uncertainty Quantification for Language Models

Content:
Sharing a new open source Python package for generation time, zero-resource hallucination detection called UQLM. It leverages state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification techniques from the academic literature to compute response-level confidence scores based on response consistency (in multiple responses to the same prompt), token probabilities, LLM-as-a-Judge, or ensembles of these. Check it out, share feedback if you have any, and reach out if you want to contribute!
