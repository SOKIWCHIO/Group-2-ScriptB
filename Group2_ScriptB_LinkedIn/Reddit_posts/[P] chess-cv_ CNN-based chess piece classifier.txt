Title: [P] chess-cv: CNN-based chess piece classifier

Content:
Hi r/MachineLearning, here is my weekend project: [chess-cv](https://github.com/S1M0N38/chess-cv)

A machine learning project that trains a lightweight CNN (156k parameters) from scratch to classify chess pieces from 32×32 pixel square images. The model achieves ~99.85% accuracy on synthetic training data generated by combining 55 board styles (256×256px) with 64 piece sets (32×32px) from chess.com and lichess.

By rendering pieces onto different board backgrounds and extracting individual squares, the model learns robust piece recognition across various visual styles.

| Dataset                                                                                  | Accuracy | F1-Score (Macro) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :----------------: |
| Test Data                                                                                | 99.85%   | 99.89%           |
| [S1M0N38/chess-cv-openboard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/S1M0N38/chess-cv-openboard) | -    | 95.78%           |

(OpenBoard has an unbalanced class distribution (many more samples for empty square class, so accuracy is not representative )

Happy to hear any feedback!


Comments:
- I don't know why, but I read cheese pie classifier at first glance
- For a second I thought this was a CNN that determined which movie was the best next move based on an “image” of a chess board
