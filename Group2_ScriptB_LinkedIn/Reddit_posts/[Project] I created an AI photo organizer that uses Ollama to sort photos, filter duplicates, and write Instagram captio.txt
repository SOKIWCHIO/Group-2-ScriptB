Title: [Project] I created an AI photo organizer that uses Ollama to sort photos, filter duplicates, and write Instagram captions.

Hey everyone at r/MachineLearning,

I wanted to share a Python project I've been working on called the **AI Instagram Organizer**.

**The Problem:** I had thousands of photos from a recent trip, and the thought of manually sorting them, finding the best ones, and thinking of captions was overwhelming. I wanted a way to automate this using local LLMs.

**The Solution:** I built a script that uses a multimodal model via Ollama (like LLaVA, Gemma, or Llama 3.2 Vision) to do all the heavy lifting.

**Key Features:**

* **Chronological Sorting:** It reads EXIF data to organize posts by the date they were taken.
* **Advanced Duplicate Filtering:** It uses multiple perceptual hashes and a dynamic threshold to remove repetitive shots.
* **AI Caption & Hashtag Generation:** For each post folder it creates, it writes several descriptive caption options and a list of hashtags.
* **Handles HEIC Files:** It automatically converts Apple's HEIC format to JPG.

It’s been a really fun project and a great way to explore what's possible with local vision models. I'd love to get your feedback and see if it's useful to anyone else!

Since this is my first time building an open-source AI project, any feedback is welcome. And if you like it, a star on GitHub would really make my day! ⭐
