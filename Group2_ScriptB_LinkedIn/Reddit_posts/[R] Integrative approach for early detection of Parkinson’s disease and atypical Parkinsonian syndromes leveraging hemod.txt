A recent study in Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine explores an efficient approach to early Parkinson’s detection using time-series data from low-cost sensors processed on microcontrollers. The lightweight hybrid machine learning model offers potential for accessible screening in low-resource settings.

Highlights:

• Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder affecting motor and non-motor functions. Early detection of PD is essential for improving patient outcomes and quality of life

• This study proposes a multimodal hardware based wearable integrated with a novel machine learning framework for early, accurate and remote diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.

• Analyses diverse data sets, including hemodynamic parameters, gait patterns, and hand tremor metrics including bradykinesia and rigidity.

• Achieves high accuracy through advanced algorithms, integrating artificial intelligence and intuitive user interface, thus providing a robust diagnostic tool.
