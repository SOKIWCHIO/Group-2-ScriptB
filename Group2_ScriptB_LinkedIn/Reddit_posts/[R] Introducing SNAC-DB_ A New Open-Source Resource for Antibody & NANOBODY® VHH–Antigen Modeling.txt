Title: [R] Introducing SNAC-DB: A New Open-Source Resource for Antibody & NANOBODY® VHH–Antigen Modeling

Content:
Predicting antibody and NANOBODY® VHH–antigen complexes remain a notable gap in current AI models, limiting their utility in drug discovery. We present **SNAC-DB**, a machine-learning-ready database and pipeline developed by structural biologists and ML researchers to address this challenge.

Key features of SNAC-DB include:

·       **Expanded Coverage:** 32 % more structural diversity than SAbDab, capturing overlooked assemblies such as antibodies/nanobodies as antigens, complete multi-chain epitopes, and weak CDR crystal contacts.

·       **ML-Friendly Data:** Cleaned PDB/mmCIF files, atom37 NumPy arrays, and unified CSV metadata to eliminate preprocessing hurdles.

·       **Transparent Redundancy Control:** Multi-threshold Foldseek clustering for principled sample weighting, ensuring every experimental structure contributes.

·       **Rigorous Benchmark:** An out-of-sample test set comprising public PDB entries post–May 30, 2024 (disclosed) and confidential therapeutic complexes.

Using this benchmark, we evaluated six leading models (AlphaFold2.3‐multimer, Boltz-2, Boltz-1x, Chai-1, DiffDock-PP, GeoDock) and found that success rates rarely exceed 25 %, built-in confidence metrics and ranking often misprioritize predictions, and all struggle with novel targets and binding poses.

We presented this work at the Forty-Second International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025) Workshop on DataWorld: Unifying Data Curation Frameworks Across Domains (https://dataworldicml2025.github.io/) in Vancouver.

We hope SNAC-DB will accelerate the development and evaluation of more accurate models for antibody complex prediction
