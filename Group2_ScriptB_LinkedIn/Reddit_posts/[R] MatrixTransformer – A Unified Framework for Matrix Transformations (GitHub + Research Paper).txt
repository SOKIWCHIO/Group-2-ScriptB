Title: [R] MatrixTransformer – A Unified Framework for Matrix Transformations (GitHub + Research Paper)

Content:
Hi everyone,

Over the past few months, I’ve been working on a new library and research paper that unify structure-preserving matrix transformations within a high-dimensional framework (hypersphere and hypercubes).

Today I’m excited to share: MatrixTransformer—a Python library and paper built around a 16-dimensional decision hypercube that enables smooth, interpretable transitions between matrix types like

* Symmetric
* Hermitian
* Toeplitz
* Positive Definite
* Diagonal
* Sparse
* ...and many more

It is a lightweight, structure-preserving transformer designed to operate directly in 2D and nD matrix space, focusing on:

* Symbolic & geometric planning
* Matrix-space transitions (like high-dimensional grid reasoning)
* Reversible transformation logic
* Compatible with standard Python + NumPy

It simulates transformations without traditional training—more akin to procedural cognition than deep nets.

# What’s Inside:

* A unified interface for transforming matrices while preserving structure
* Interpolation paths between matrix classes (balancing energy & structure)
* Benchmark scripts from the paper
* Extensible design—add your own matrix rules/types
* Use cases in ML regularization and quantum-inspired computation

If you’re working in machine learning, numerical methods, symbolic AI, or quantum simulation, I’d love your feedback.  
Feel free to open issues, contribute, or share ideas.

Thanks for reading!
