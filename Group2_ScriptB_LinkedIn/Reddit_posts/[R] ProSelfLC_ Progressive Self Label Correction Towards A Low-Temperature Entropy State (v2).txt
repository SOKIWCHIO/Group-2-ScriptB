Title: [R] ProSelfLC: Progressive Self Label Correction Towards A Low-Temperature Entropy State (v2)

Content:
TLDR: Two takeaways are below.

>1st takeaway: There exist three well-accepted findings: (a) deep models easily fit random noise; (b) deep networks learn simple semantic patterns before fitting noise; (c) modern deep neural works tend to be over-confident. In this paper, we disclose a new insightful one, which complements them: *Deep neural networks become less confident of learning semantic patterns before fitting noise when the label noise rises*.  
>  
>2nd takeaway: *A new technical proposal*, inspired by the new finding and miscalibration analysis, is introduced to decrease the entropy of self knowledge. Concretely, we propose to use an Annealed Temperature and learn towards a revised low-temperature entropy state.

&#x200B;

Though [this research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00118) studies deep machine learning, its findings are quite consistent with deep human learning: *people start to learn the truth out of noise with a low confidence, and gradually compress the truth pieces out of a noisy world, with an increasing confidence by gradually and more comprehensively understanding the noisy world surrounding us*.
