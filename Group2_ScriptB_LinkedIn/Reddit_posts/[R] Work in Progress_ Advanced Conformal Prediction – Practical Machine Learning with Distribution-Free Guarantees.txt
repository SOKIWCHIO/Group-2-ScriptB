Title: [R] Work in Progress: Advanced Conformal Prediction â€“ Practical Machine Learning with Distribution-Free Guarantees

Content:
Hi r/MachineLearning community!

Iâ€™ve been working on a deep-dive project into modern conformal prediction techniques and wanted to share it with you. It's a hands-on, practical guide built from the ground up â€” aimed at making advanced uncertainty estimation accessible to everyone with just basic school math and Python skills.

Some highlights:

* Covers everything from classical conformal prediction to adaptive, Mondrian, and distribution-free methods for deep learning.
* Strong focus on real-world implementation challenges: covariate shift, non-exchangeability, small data, and computational bottlenecks.
* Practical code examples using state-of-the-art libraries likeÂ *Crepes*,Â *TorchCP*, and others.
* Written with a Python-first, applied mindset â€” bridging theory and practice.

Iâ€™d love to hear any thoughts, feedback, or questions from the community â€” especially from anyone working with uncertainty quantification, prediction intervals, or distribution-free ML techniques.

(If anyoneâ€™s interested in an early draft of the guide or wants to chat about the methods, feel free to DM me!)

Thanks so much! ðŸ™Œ
