Title: [R] [N] REaLTabFormer: Generating Realistic Relational and Tabular Data using Transformers

Content:
Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02041](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02041)

Generate synthetic data from single tabular data using GPT. It also works on relational datasets! No fine-tuning and works out-of-the-box.

We also removed the guesswork on how long (epochs) the generative model for a single tabular data is trained. We propose the Qδ statistic and apply statistical bootstrapping to define a threshold to robustly detect overfitting.  Perk: no need for a hold-out data!

Data copying is also a problem in generative models. This means that training data may be learned and copied by the model during sampling. We attempt to mitigate data copying.

We implement target masking to deliberately create missing values in each observation in the data. The mask is a special token that is ignored during sampling. This forces the model to probabilistically impute the token, adding uncertainty to the generated data.

REaLTabFormer is open-sourced and available on PyPi → pip install realtabformer
