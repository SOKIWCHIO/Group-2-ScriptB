Title: how to estimate how many rare autosomal dominant diseases are gain-of-function?

Content:
For a school project, we are attempting to build a sort of knowledge graph and then machine learning model to analyze rare autosomal dominant diseases. How can I best find an estimate of the title query? I am searching literature, but even still having a difficult time finding any conclusive results. Thank you for any suggestions.
