Title: nearly finished with phd but i see no perspective for me... help

Content:
sorry people, long text ahead. i need to vent and i need the perspective of other scientists.

i will soon have my phd title and will be ready to look for a job. problem is that during the 4,5 years working on my thesis project in medical research i got completely disillusioned with research in general. the thought of going back into the laboratory environment with socially inept, competitive, morally compromised people makes me physically sick. in the horrible process to get things published in “good” journals (i didn’t care about impact factors but my boss insisted) i had to do myself what i most hate about the science work - totally exaggerate my meek findings and pretend they will save the world. combined with seeing how some of my coworkers generated data now i can’t trust any publication anymore. the method to generate data in my laboratory was to repeat the same protocol again and again until (most probably by accident) you get the data you want and then not question this process. i tried to improve things, question methods, test protocols but this was frowned upon. e.g. i would have liked to learn properly how to use the thousands-euros machine i used but my boss didn’t want to pay for the class so i used up hundreds of euros worth of reagents to create very crappy data. i used the internet to get help because no one in my group knew more about this machine than me, also people who have been working and publishing with the same method for years and years. and this is not some tiny institute somewhere, it has a excellent reputation and my group publishes in high impact factor journals.

if you take an honest look at your work group, is this usual for research? i haven’t been in a lot of other labs but for a year i also worked as an intern in an other country in a totally different field of research and things were pretty similar. i was too unexperienced to question postdocs/professors then, but they made me do the same experiment every day for a year because someone has published it but i could never every reproduce it. instead of drawing the conclusion that the original publication and the experimental setup was flawed probably right now there is still some other intern doing it again and again and again….

how much power would i have to improve things if i was a postdoc somewhere? is life as postdoc better than as phd student? at least in europe? i heard (from severy people who have worked there) that in the u.s. they are kind of laboratory slaves. i don’t want to have a career and i don’t need much money.i just want a job in something that makes sense and enough free time to have some kind of social life and a family. 

also originally i wanted to become a wildlife biologist or behavioural biologist, but i turned in another direction since there are so few jobs in these subjects. it it too late to change the subject in such a dramatic way? i don’t want to work in a field of research anymore that claims to be “important” for humanity or something. i would like to watch some little amphibians in a pond somewhere instead…….. 

sorry for all the text. i just look on how much energy i invested to come to this stage (10 years) but right now it all feels so senseless…

edit: thanks so much for the many comments... :)

No... not in my experience. If ever found myself in a lab like that, I'd be reporting them for scientific misconduct. Most labs I've worked in are skeptical of all data until it's been repeated a few times and backed up by other experiments.

- Uhm... whoa dude. I think you need to get your degree and pop smoke. Don't let this lab define your experience as a research professional or you as a researcher. Find someplace else then reevaluate.

Also, *after* you get your degree you need to have a heart to heart with your department head about this stuff.
- This subreddit seems to be full of very optimistic and positive people that i think have never tried to get a job outside academia. But in my experience, people who actually have all seem to come to the same conclusions as you.

My question is, what makes you want to devote any more of your life to this system? What do you think you are going to get out of it? Are you happy with your rewards? 

The system is set up to use the unquestioning labour of young people, while the reality of the career on offer has changed beyond anything a current PI has ever experienced. You might find a better lab, you might get trained on expensive equipment - but for what? To do two or three more post-docs?
- Your lab seems awful. If I ran an experiment until I got the result I wanted I would be kicked out of my program. I'm not in medicine though so nobody in my field is doing it for the money or prestige. There are aspects to research that are annoying and universal. You always have to sell your results and convince people that they're earth shatteringly important. But welcome to the human race, you have to do that no matter what you do. Get your degree and find a lab and topic that isn't morally bankrupt. There are plenty out there, it sounds like to got stuck in with a rotten bunch.
- Not a grad student (yet) but I have worked in 2 separate labs. Thankfully both PIs are the type of person that's like "we need to make sure we do everything 100% right every step of the way and check for any errors and if they're bad enough, throw it out."

For me, the only advice on ethics I can give is what I feel and follow. I will never, ever, compromise my ethics and morals to anyone for any reason. This may come off as arrogant and close doors, but you know what, if someone doesn't like you because you refuse to smudge data or protocol to get a positive/what you want, that only means they do it and want to drag you down to the muck. I take scientific honesty and ethics very serious and it gets my blood boiling when people commit fraud.

Report any misconduct to whoever you have to and go from there. It would be horrible if you stretched your results too far and they come into question and even accuse you of fraud.
- Sounds like you work at a shitty lab. Ever consider looking elsewhere? 

What that place sounds like is a complete shill. They just publish something sensational or bank on their data seeming important.
- Have you ever thought on doing research on another country?
I'm from Mexico and, well, researchers are by far not the best paid professionals here, but as far as I've worked with people in the lab and field (with wildlife biologists), I do can tell you that we're one of the happoest people (at least where I'm from).
- at the end of the thesis most people are so sick of the situation that they dont want to go further. Some have set up jobs so they know they will try them at least. Others start looking for jobs after graduating. Your complaints are not uncommon, more so in medical research. Ultimately the question is whether you want to study some topic and where can you do that. Do your best to finish your work with your bosses oversight and blessing and then take a break and think it over. If you cant do that easily enough take a break sooner. Good luck.
- >if you take an honest look at your work group, is this usual for research? 

This sounds like a really shitty lab you were working within.  I've heard of these kinds of environments, and I've stayed away from these types of labs.  If you find this happening on any level, I would recommend leaving *immediately*.

I'll be honest, there's a degree of salesmanship about your project that you must do when you do research.  It's *your* work, *you* should be proud of that work, and *you* need to emphasize why that work is important.  There *is* the problem of overemphasizing how the findings may be a cure or huge direction, but to be honest, a good lab knows how to correctly show the impact of such research without even getting close to anything odd.

>how much power would i have to improve things if i was a postdoc somewhere? 

Depends on the lab.  My grad work was in a smaller lab and I'm a postdoc in a very new lab, and I really have had the opportunity to dictate how things run for myself at the least.  Improving requires you to act though, which I find that many postdocs are reluctant to do.

But being a postdoc, for me at least, wasn't much of a difference from grad school.  I was significantly wiser starting over, and I also was much more aware of traps and problems that can arise.

The biggest difference had to do with me being proactive about my own career.  In graduate school, I found myself reacting to things because I didn't see them coming.  As a postdoc, I've been finding that I'm better prepared in not just taking the blows, but also delivering them back unexpectedly, be it against PIs, other postdocs, other students, or administration.  Not in terms of being competitive, but in terms of even setting up collaborations and doing the right thing.  It's been a fight, but I've felt very much empowered.

>sorry for all the text. i just look on how much energy i invested to come to this stage (10 years) but right now it all feels so senseless…

The thing about research is that it's important to know the true impact of what you're doing.  It's not immediate, and it may not go anywhere.  But you have to keep in mind the larger picture when you're doing that work.  It may be a very little thing, but it's information that does and should play a larger impact in the scheme of things.

That's difficult for most people to accept I think.  Both postdocs and grad students, I've found, get into these ruts of doing other people's work rather than searching a bit themselves for things or aspects within or outside of their projects to be excited about.  But, to be honest, if you don't like that aspect, doing a postdoc wouldn't help.
- It seems typical actually (at least for me).  All of what you wrote I've seen first hand.  I was similarly disillusioned, enough that after 2 postdocs I quit and went into IT.   The only thing i can say is, look carefully at what job options are out there, that you could get, that you could enjoy doing.  For me, it was a long transition, a series of very poor paying jobs, until I got enough experience and skillset to pull in good jobs.  Now I get recruiters calling every week (at least).  Very different from when I started, where 100+ job applications failed.
- This podcast might be worth a listen:

- Nope, completely normal in so-called 'upper-tier' research unis and in any other workplace in the US (like retail, medicine, and education at least, last two are more hideous than research could dream of being) as far as I see. 


Higher you go on in the tiers the nastier it gets, sort of like those scary poop-sock zerg-rush raiding guilds in MMOs even down to the spying and sabotage to put it in super nerdy terms.


Meh, human nature, if you work with others have to get over it or starve to death under a bridge. Do what you feel is right when you can escape with it otherwise follow along in line.
- I did a medical research PhD, but I was really lucky and got to see the "commercial" side of things - it was quite eye-opening and forced me to make the time to understand what I was trying to achieve in life. I wrote a few blog posts a while back on these topics, you may find them useful:

- I agree. That's super shady
- i would very much life to chance to ecology. i think my knowledge of a variety of genetics/microbiology methods i learned (tried to learn ;) could be of use there, too. just recently on vacation i caught myself studying the wildlife of little rock pools by the beach for hours instead of looking at the surfers like my friends. 

but jobs in that field are so very rare where i live... and so many people apply.. i'll try but we'll see....

The thing is, every time I hear this from other postdocs and grad students, I feel like people just feel either defeated or expect a hand-out, or that the paths of their lives "in academia" is sort of set in a specific path.  Which is funny given that we're in fields that are dictated by unmarked paths.

The reality is that, to some degree, we *can* fight the system as a group.  Complaining and saying that it's broke doesn't help anyone.  Heck, I think most graduates simply have no clue what they would do if even given a PI position.

I feel like many of us have expectations that things be given to us, but I see so little pro-active stances.  Ok, so academic research is tough and the jobs are drying up.  You probably should have figured that out by the 3rd year of graduate school.  You'd have to be pretty myopic, especially within the last decade or so, to not see how difficult academia has been.  And for me it's clear that most postdocs, most graduates, simply aren't the type that should be given labs in the first place.

If things are bad to the point of you being used as "unquestioning labour," then it's up to you to push back as a postdoc against your PI.  And if you still can't get that through, it's up to you to figure out a way around your PI and find something you *are* interested in finding out.

What's the worst that will happen?  Your PI fires you/lets you go after your annual contract is up, and you're forced to find an industry/teaching/non-academic position you were probably already going to go towards anyway?

I just feel like it's not that much of a risk.  It requires some backbone on people's part to fight when they know they're doing the right thing.

No. There are plenty of places in the business world that are filled with boasting, but that's not most jobs. Maybe the loudest people in their industries, but not the majority of people in those industries.
