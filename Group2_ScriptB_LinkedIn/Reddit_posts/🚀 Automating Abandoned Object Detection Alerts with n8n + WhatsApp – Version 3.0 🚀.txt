Title: ðŸš€ Automating Abandoned Object Detection Alerts with n8n + WhatsApp â€“ Version 3.0 ðŸš€

Content:
ðŸš¨ **No More Manual CCTV Monitoring!** ðŸš¨

Iâ€™ve built a **fully automated abandoned object detection system** using **YOLOv11 + ByteTrack**, seamlessly integrated with **n8n** and **Twilio WhatsApp API**.

Key highlights of Version 3.0:  
âœ… **Real-time detection** of abandoned objects in video streams.  
âœ… **Instant WhatsApp notifications** â€” no human monitoring required.  
âœ… **Detected frames saved to Google Drive** for demo or record-keeping purposes.  
âœ… **n8n workflow** connects Google Colab detection to Twilio for automated alerts.  
âœ… Alerts include optional **image snapshots** to see exactly what was detected.

This pipeline demonstrates how **AI + automation** can make public spaces, offices, and retail safer while reducing human overhead.

ðŸ’¡ Imagine deploying this in airports, malls, or offices â€” instantly notifying staff when a suspicious object is left unattended.
