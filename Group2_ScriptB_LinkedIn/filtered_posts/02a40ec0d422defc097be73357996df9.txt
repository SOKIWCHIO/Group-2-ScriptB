If you are looking for a principled, efficient approach to uncertainty in neural networks, that we show correlates well with humans, checkout our recent AAAI paper #aaai2025 #ai #ml #llm

🎉 #AAAI2025 is in the air in Philadelphia! 🎉
I'm thrilled to share our latest work: "Bayesian Low-Rank Learning (Bella):
A Practical Approach to Bayesian Deep Learning" is currently presented at #AAAI2025.

The computational complexity of Bayesian learning has long been a barrier to its practical adoption in large-scale tasks. While Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer exceptional robustness and resilience to unseen or out-of-distribution inputs, their high computational cost often hinders their practicality. With Bella, we introduce a novel framework that dramatically reduces the computational burden of BNNs. By applying multiple low-rank perturbations to parameters from a pre-trained neural network, Bella allows both vanilla deep ensembles and advanced techniques like Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to scale effectively—even for large models.

Key highlights of Bella:
🚀 Reduced Computational Load: Significantly fewer trainable parameters needed for Bayesian posterior approximation.
📈 Enhanced Performance: Maintain or surpass traditional Bayesian learning methods and non-Bayesian baselines.
🌐 Real-World Impact: Proven effectiveness on large-scale tasks like ImageNet, CAMELYON17, DomainNet, VQA with CLIP, and LLaVA.
A huge shoutout to my incredible collaborators Afshar Shamsi, Assoc. Prof. Ehsan A. & Assoc. Prof. Damith Ranasinghe
