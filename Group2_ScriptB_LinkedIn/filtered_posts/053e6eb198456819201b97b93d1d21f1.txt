🫀 How can we trust a model of human physiology if we don’t fully understand its uncertainty?

In our latest paper, "Quantification of Total Uncertainty in the Physics-Informed Reconstruction of CVSim-6 Physiology", we tackle this challenge by developing Monte-Carlo X-TFC, a novel physics-informed approach that decomposes and quantifies all sources of uncertainty—aleatoric (random noise in data), epistemic (lack of knowledge or insufficient data), and model-form (misspecification of model equations).

Why does this matter? In computational physiology, we often rely on models to predict patient outcomes, optimize treatments, or design digital twins of human organs. But reality is messy—data are sparse, sensors introduce noise, and no model perfectly captures the full complexity of human biology. If we want these models to be trustworthy, we must not only make predictions but also quantify how confident we are in those predictions.

Our method, MC X-TFC, does just that. It blends physics-based regularization with data-driven learning to reconstruct physiological states and estimate parameters—even in cases where data are missing, or the model itself is flawed. We put this to the test on the CVSim-6 cardiovascular model, demonstrating how uncertainty interacts with physics-informed learning and showing that we can extract meaningful insights even when working with imperfect information.

This work is part of the special issue “Uncertainty Quantification for Healthcare and Biological Systems” in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, and I’m really grateful to my co-authors Zongren Zou, Daniele E. Schiavazzi, and George Karniadakis for their collaboration on this exciting research!
