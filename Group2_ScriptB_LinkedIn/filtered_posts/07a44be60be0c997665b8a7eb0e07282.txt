"Building AI Products In The Probabilistic Era" - this blog post provides an engaging articulation of how building AI products requires a significant change in our overall approach to software.

While I find the tone a little overenthusiastic, and am not sure about the faux mathematical representation, the key themes expressed resonate deeply.

Interesting share—completely agree that building AI products requires a mindset shift. As a founder building in this space, I’ve realized we’re no longer designing deterministic systems but orchestrating probabilistic ones. That’s a big cultural change for teams used to traditional software.

Conventional software (Probabilistic) vs. LLM applications (Deterministic)  Approach!

A deterministic approach always produces the same output for a given input, based on explicit, rule-based logic (e.g., a calculator). This is the foundation of traditional software development.

A probabilistic approach produces a plausible, but not fixed, output based on statistical likelihood (e.g., an LLM). This is the core of generative AI.

Handling Ambiguity: Human language is complex and often has multiple interpretations. A probabilistic system can weigh different possibilities to provide the most likely and relevant response.

Creativity & Diversity: It can generate novel and unique content (text, images, code) by drawing from patterns in its training data, something a fixed-rule system cannot do.

Adaptability:
