Generative AI Researcher

3 年  已编辑

Two papers that I have been personally excited about for sometime are finally accepted to #Neurips2022. Thanks to all my collaborators for persisting and bringing these exciting works to light. #AIresearch #deeplearning #contrastivelearning #UQ #MLsafety #graphs

1. Delta-UQ: A new principle for uncertainty estimation that exploits the lack of shift-invariance in NTKs. Delta-UQ is effective at OOD generalization, anomaly rejection and sequential optimization. Paper: https://lnkd.in/giSkGBz5. Rushil Anirudh Vivek Sivaraman Narayanaswamy Peer-Timo Bremer
2. We take a deep look into graph contrastive learning and find that data-centric properties known to be crucial to the success of visual CL can fail to hold for graph CL. Paper: https://lnkd.in/gFaSqkDa Puja Trivedi Mark Heimann Danai Koutra Ekdeep Lubana
