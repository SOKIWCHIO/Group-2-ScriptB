Check out our latest paper in the Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine! 📚✨

Deep learning models are incredible, but they come with uncertainties. This is especially true for MRI reconstruction, where deep learning models can struggle with certain regions of the image. Our research introduces PixCUE (Pixel Classification Uncertainty Estimation), a groundbreaking approach to uncertainty estimation in MRI reconstruction. PixCUE generates both the reconstructed image and an uncertainty map in a single forward pass through the deep learning model, significantly reducing computational costs. 🧠🔍
