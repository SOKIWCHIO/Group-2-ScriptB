🏇  Forecasting the Finish Line: Students Use Machine Learning to Predict Horse Race Outcomes 📰  

CAAI is pleased to share our new article on Medium, where AI and machine learning explore forecasting the outcomes of live horse races.

This piece describes how participants received historical racing data from tracks across the United States and were tasked with building their own models to forecast real-time race results.

"While the setting was unique, the skills were transferable. Forecasting is about understanding uncertainty and using available information to make informed predictions. This is something every industry contends with, from healthcare to finance to horse racing! The techniques used at this hackathon have broad relevance beyond the racetrack and have helped the participating undergraduate students develop machine learning skills through experience."
