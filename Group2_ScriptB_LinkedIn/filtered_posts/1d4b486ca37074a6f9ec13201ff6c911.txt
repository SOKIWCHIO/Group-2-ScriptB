Driving Innovation Through Embedded AI & Cyber-Physical Systems

7 个月

We are excited to announce that our paper has been accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)!

What’s it about?
Our work tackles a fundamental challenge in Imprecise Probabilistic Machine Learning: how to empirically derive credal regions (sets of plausible probabilities) without strong assumptions. By leveraging Conformal Prediction, we introduce a new method that:
• Provides provable coverage guarantees
• Reduces prediction set sizes
• Allows to disentangle different types of uncertainty (epistemic & aleatoric)

Breaking new ground:
Previous approaches required the consonance assumption, which was required to relate conformal prediction and imprecise probabilities. Our method removes this constraint and introduces:
• A practical approach to handling ambiguous ground truth, allowing predictions even when labels are uncertain
• A calibration property that ensures the true data-generating process is included with a high probability

This breakthrough enables reliable uncertainty estimation in real-world applications!

Why does it matter?
This work is a step forward for trustworthy AI. Understanding when and how to trust model predictions is critical for deploying AI in:
• Healthcare – Ensuring diagnostic models acknowledge uncertainty
• Autonomous Systems – Improving decision-making in uncertain environments
• Finance & Risk Assessment – More reliable probabilistic forecasting

A true collaborative effort!
This paper is the result of a fantastic collaboration between:
• Michele Caprio (Former Postdoc at the PRECISE Center/Penn, now at The University of Manchester)
• David Stutz (Google DeepMind)
• Shuo Li (5th-year PhD Student at the PRECISE Center/Penn Engineering)
• Arnaud Doucet (Google DeepMind)

What sets our work apart:
There’s existing research on imprecise probabil
