Webinar Announcement – September 25
Risk Modeling with Bayesian Networks – Beyond BowTie: A Cybersecurity Case Study

For decades, the BowTie method has helped risk professionals visualize threats, barriers, and consequences. But today’s risks demand more than static diagrams.

What if your model could simulate scenarios, quantify uncertainty, and adapt to new information?

In this webinar, we’ll introduce Risk-Centric Causal Networks (RCCNs) — an evolution of BowTie models powered by Bayesian Networks and enhanced by Generative AI.

On the agenda:
- How to move from static visuals to living, probabilistic models
- How RCCNs integrate both qualitative and quantitative risk perspectives
- Live case study: Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, built using:
• Hellixia – GenAI for rapid domain discovery and model building
• BayesiaLab – Probabilistic reasoning, simulation, and sensitivity analysis
• HellixMap – Qualitative sharing of the causal structure
• WebSimulator – Interactive tool for probabilistic inference and risk assessment

Bonus: We’ll publish the final model both on HellixMap (for qualitative sharing) and on the WebSimulator (for stakeholder-facing inference and scenario analysis).

This event also marks the commercial launch of HellixMap and WebSimulator v3.0.

Let’s move beyond BowTie. Join us to explore a new generation of risk modeling — smarter, faster, and more collaborative.
