The trouble with uncertainty quantification in ML is a lack of guarantee: prediction intervals that are too short and class probabilities are miscalibrated.

A solution: conformal prediction.

To get started, I wrote a beginner-friendly, hands-on book.

I liked the book. The explanations were intuitive, and the code examples were helpful. I hope to see Venn–Abers predictors in the next edition of the book.

I enjoyed the balanced presentation in this book. "Conformal Prediction Without the Hype" could be an alternative title... unlike some other books on the market :-)

It's ordered! 🎉 it will be for our Data teams at Eulidia, next to the one on interpretability  😉😊 
Thanks Christoph Molnar for writing such high quality and deeply relevant content in a very accessible way.
