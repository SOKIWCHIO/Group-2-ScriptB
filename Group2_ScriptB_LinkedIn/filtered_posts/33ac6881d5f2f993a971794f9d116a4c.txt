🌊 New Publication: Improving Flood Prediction in a Geospatial Uncertain World 🌊

Floods are becoming more frequent and severe, and predicting them accurately is a huge challenge. Our new paper takes a closer look at one important question: How reliable is the data we use to forecast floods? Xiao Huang

Yu, J., Li, Y., Huang, X., & Ye, X. (2025). Data quality and uncertainty issues in flood prediction: a systematic review. International Journal of Digital Earth, 18(1), 2495738.

We found that:
 ✔️ Flood prediction depends on many data sources—rainfall, river flows, infrastructure, and land features.
 ✔️ These datasets often have gaps, inconsistencies, or uncertainties, especially in complex environments.
💡 Looking ahead, we see big opportunities in:
 ✔️ Using AI and new technologies to improve accuracy.
 ✔️ Building real-time and integrated datasets.
 ✔️ Paying more attention to regions that remain understudied.
Our review not only maps the challenges but also points toward more reliable flood forecasting for the future.
