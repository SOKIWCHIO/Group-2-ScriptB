Smarter Spectroscopy With a New Machine Learning Approach to Estimate Prediction Uncertainty
A new study demonstrates how a machine learning technique, quantile regression forest, can provide both accurate predictions and sample-specific uncertainty estimates from infrared spectroscopic data. The work was applied to soil and agricultural samples, highlighting its value for chemometric modeling.

Excited to share that my paper with Rob Weiss, titled “Bayesian Shrinkage in High-Dimensional VAR Models: A Comparative Study,” has been published in the International Journal of Statistics and Probability. The study offers a systematic comparison of shrinkage methods in high-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models, addressing over-parameterization and lag order uncertainty.

The cover is out for our paper "Modeling the Behavior of Complex Aqueous Electrolytes" where we show how machine learning interatomic potentials can provide insights into the structure of electrolytes.
