👍🏻 Great article (as always), thanks for sharing Christoph Molnar !

🤔 If using more "common" terms in Data Science, aleatoric uncertainty could be seen as variance and epistemic uncertainty as bias, right ?

🌳 Even if these uncertainties may be difficult to distinguish in real case scenario, it can be possible to "separate" these error terms in various training situations (example Underfitting with large bias error, Overfitting with large variance error), and there are some general guidance to reduce bias or variance : for example in tree-based methods, ensemble algorithms like Random forests are able to reduce variance (the predicted value is close from the actual result and is "stable" thanks to the individual trees trained in parallel in slightly different situations and the averaging of their individual predictions), whereas boosted tree are able to reduce bias (the building of sequential individual tree "correcting" the errors from the previous one enable to be as close as possible to the target result, but makes this algorithm sensitive to noise in the dataset).
