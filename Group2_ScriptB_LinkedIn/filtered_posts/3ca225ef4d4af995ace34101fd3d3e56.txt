📢 I am delighted to share that the second publication from my PhD research has been published in Ore Geology Reviews:
“A generative neural network approach to uncertainty and risk-return analysis in mineral prospectivity modelling.” 🎉

In our first study, we tackled data imbalance in mineral prospectivity modelling using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). While this improved predictive accuracy, it didn’t address a key challenge: understanding the uncertainty and risk behind predictions.

This new paper builds on that foundation by introducing a CVAE-based framework that captures both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties and integrates them into a novel risk-return framework that uses uncertainty measures with Getis-Ord G* spatial clustering approach to categorize targets into four risk-return groups. Our results show that high-return zones occupy just 4% of the Canadian land area yet contain nearly 95% of known deposits, while also highlighting how newly identified prospective zones align within the four risk-return categories.

A huge thank you to my Prof. Charles L. Bérubé and Dr. Reza Ghanati for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this research.

I’m excited to continue pushing how AI can improve mineral exploration by delivering predictions that are accurate, transparent, and truly useful for decision-making.
