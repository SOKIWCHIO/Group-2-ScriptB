😍 Excited to share an incredible milestone for our research on AI! 

After years of dedication to advancing #imprecise uncertainty modelling in artificial intelligence, I am thrilled to announce that our recent works have been accepted at #ICLR 2025 (IF: 48), one of the most prestigious venues in AI. This achievement is deeply rooted in the decade of research on Imprecise Probability Theory, which has laid the foundation for these cutting-edge developments.

Our research focuses on pushing the boundaries of AI robustness, accuracy, and advanced uncertainty quantification, addressing challenges that are critical for high-stakes applications. Here’s a glimpse of the impactful contributions we’re making:

Paper 1️⃣ Redefining AI Predictions with #Random-Set Neural Networks.
This groundbreaking work, Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal, Muhammad Mubashar, Kaizheng Wang and Fabio Cuzzolin, showcases how moving beyond probability theory to random sets models the way we approach robustness and out-of-distribution detection. It proves that random-set predictions significantly outperform Bayesian, evidential, and ensemble-based methods, setting a new standard in uncertainty-aware AI.

Paper 2️⃣ #Credal Wrapper for Model Averaging: A New Paradigm in Uncertainty Estimation.
Together with Kaizheng Wang, and Fabio Cuzzolin in collaboration with David Moens, and Hans Hallez, we developed an innovative framework that integrates credal sets (convex sets of probabilities) to enhance rich uncertainty estimation. This approach achieves unparalleled performance in both (epistemic & aleatoric) uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution detection, solving key challenges in AI reliability.
