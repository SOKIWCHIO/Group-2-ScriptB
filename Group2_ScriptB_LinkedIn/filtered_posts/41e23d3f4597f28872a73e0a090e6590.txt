9/100 Probabilistic vs Deterministic AI
What's the Difference? 🤖✨

Probabilistic AI thrives on uncertainty and possibilities—it calculates likelihoods to make decisions. Think of it as making a well-informed guess. (GPT models, Llama etc)

Deterministic AI, on the other hand, operates on strict rules and logic, producing the same result every single time when given the same input. 🚦(Super AI)

Let me know in the comments if you wanna see a demo. 

Understanding the difference is key to choosing the right AI model for your business needs. Probabilistic AI suits scenarios where uncertainty is natural (e.g., weather predictions), while deterministic AI excels in rule-based systems (e.g., automated checkouts).
