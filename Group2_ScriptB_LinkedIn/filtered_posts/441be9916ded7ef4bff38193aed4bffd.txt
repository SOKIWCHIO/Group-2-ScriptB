Excited to announce that our research, "A Learning-Based Robust Optimization Framework for Synchromodal Freight Transportation under Uncertainty," has been published in Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review.

Our study addresses the critical challenges of uncertainty in synchromodal freight transportation by integrating machine learning with robust optimization to deliver more explainable and flexible solutions.

Key findings:
✅ Road travel time uncertainties significantly impact transshipment operations, storage, and delay costs, highlighting the need for data-driven decisions.
✅ The upstream prediction module, leveraging a Bayesian Neural Network, improves operational performance in synchromodal networks.
✅ Scenario-based adjustable uncertainty sets provide decision-makers with dynamic and flexible operational strategies.
✅ Experiments with up to 700 shipment requests demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed framework.
✅ Carbon tax sensitivity analysis reveals its influence on modal share and transportation costs, offering actionable insights for policymakers.

Contributions:
✨ Introduced a novel integration of machine learning-based prediction with robust optimization for synchromodal freight transportation.
✨ Developed a Bayesian Neural Network with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification in road travel times.
✨ Proposed scenario-based adjustable uncertainty sets to bridge prediction and optimization seamlessly.
✨ Designed a preprocessing heuristic for scalable path generation, reducing computational complexity.
✨ Delivered actionable policy insights for enhancing sustainability and operational efficiency.

A heartfelt thank you to Dr. Saiedeh Razavi for her steadfast guidance and support
