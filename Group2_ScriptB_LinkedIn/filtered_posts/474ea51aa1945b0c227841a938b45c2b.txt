What if RDF could say “maybe”?

I stumbled on this topic a while ago, and it stuck with me. Traditional RDF assumes binary truth as we all know: a triple is either true or false. But real-world data is rarely so clear-cut.
Let me tell you something about Probabilistic RDF: It allows attaching probabilities to triples, enabling reasoning under uncertainty. This is especially useful in domains like biomedical data, sensor networks, or NLP, where facts are inferred, incomplete, or noisy.

📌 Example:
Instead of asserting:
<PersonX> <hasDisease> <Malaria>
we can express:
<PersonX> <hasDisease> <Malaria> [confidence = 0.7]

This opens the door to probabilistic inference, ranking query answers, and integrating Bayesian or Markov logic approaches with RDF and SPARQL.
It could be a key step toward scalable, uncertainty-aware reasoning on the Semantic Web.

🤔 What do you think, is the #SemanticWeb ready to embrace uncertainty?
Do some of you have practical experiences with Probabilistic RDF? Would love to hear about it 😊

I was able to do this in a nuanced way in my 2017 paper using nanopublications. It's a powerful approach and capability: http://peerj.com/articles/cs-106/

Thinking of RDF statements as “claims”, this would give a clear sense to what extent the claim is close to a fact.

All information is a claim, uncertainty is needed. But what about definitions? And we need normative knowledge too. Is RDF distinctly underpowered?
