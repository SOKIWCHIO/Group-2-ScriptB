When dealing with real-world signals, hidden dynamics can be unknown, non-linear, and difficult to model with equations. Neural networks are great at approximating complex patterns, but without proper guidance, they can overfit to observations and capture the wrong dynamics.

That’s why we explored a different approach: combining neural network learning from Flux with Bayesian inference in RxInfer. This method doesn’t just learn from data—it also accounts for uncertainty, ensuring more reliable and robust predictions.

The result? The best of both worlds - the adaptability of neural networks and the rigor of probabilistic estimation

We’ve put together an example demonstrating this in action—check it out and let us know what you think!   https://lnkd.in/e5KBaTiN

It is awesome work.
Here today I modified the notebook example into a script:  https://github.com/docxology/RxInferExamples.jl/tree/main/scripts/Advanced%20Examples/Integrating%20Neural%20Networks%20with%20Flux.jl , made animations https://github.com/docxology/RxInferExamples.jl/blob/main/scripts/Advanced%20Examples/Integrating%20Neural%20Networks%20with%20Flux.jl/Balance/output_images/animations/01_3d_postural_trajectory.gif and applied in, in the Textbook Group meeting https://youtu.be/P0uVOg81qE8, to postural dynamics: https://github.com/docxology/RxInferExamples.jl/blob/main/scripts/Advanced%20Examples/Integrating%20Neural%20Networks%20with%20Flux.jl/Balance/output_images/biomechanical/biomechanical_postural_sway.gif

I've been hoping for a Flux/Lux integration for a while.
