Deceptively Confident: Tackling Hallucinations in LLM Applications 🔺 


Imagine seeking medical advice from an AI chatbot that assures you with uncanny articulation that your stomach pain is probably cancer and you have mere months to live. 
Or picture an AI financial advisor confidently instructing you to move your life savings into a volatile memecoin that promises 10x returns. 

Would you trust these AI recommendations? How can you be sure that the AI isn’t just making things up — or “hallucinating” in machine learning parlance?

As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly fluent and human-like outputs, they are being rapidly integrated into real-world applications ranging from search engines to tutoring to therapy. 

However, LLMs are prone to generating outputs that seem plausible but are actually inconsistent, factually wrong, or even outright nonsensical — a phenomenon known as hallucination. When LLMs are applied in high-stakes domains like health, finance, and law, these hallucinations can lead to catastrophically bad decisions and erode trust in AI technologies as a whole.

Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is thus an urgent challenge that LLM application developers must grapple with.

Encouragingly, recent research by Google DeepMind has yielded techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of LLM outputs and screening out unreliable ones.

By incorporating these uncertainty-aware methods, developers can make their applications more transparent, robust, and ultimately worthy of human trust.

In this article, we’ll look into the primary types of uncertainty that plague LLMs, analyze tools for assessing and reducing this uncertainty, and examine how they can be integrated into a hallucination detection pipeline for LLM apps.

Aleatoric uncertainty arises from ambiguity or randomness
