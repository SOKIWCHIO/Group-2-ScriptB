“Your uncertainty comes from your longing for certainty.
Fall in love with uncertainty — and certainty will come to you.”
— Rumi
In medical imaging and other high-stakes domains, expert opinions often diverge — not because of error, but because ambiguity is inherent to the task. Traditional models typically treat uncertainty as noise, forcing a single "truth" where none may exist.
In our latest work, we take a fundamentally different approach.
Rather than suppressing uncertainty, we embrace it.
We present a Bayesian modeling framework that explicitly accounts for disagreement among annotators. By modeling both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, our system iteratively refines noisy labels and improves performance — converging toward consensus without assuming perfect agreement.
This principled, probabilistic approach not only boosts predictive accuracy by 11%, but also aligns with the realities of clinical data and human disagreement. This enables AI systems that know when they don't know — crucial for clinical deployment. 
Proud to collaborate with Shiva Fayaz and Sven Reisdorf on pushing the boundaries of trustworthy AI. 🙏
