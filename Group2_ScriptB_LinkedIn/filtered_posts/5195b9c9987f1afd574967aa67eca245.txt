𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐔𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: 𝟏𝟎 𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧 𝐋𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬

Deep learning has revolutionized the field of AI but with one major challenge: Model uncertainty.

𝕄𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕝 𝕌𝕟𝕔𝕖𝕣𝕥𝕒𝕚𝕟𝕥𝕪

Model's prediction probability is often used as a measure of uncertainty in the context of classification and this is not always correct because the model's predicted probabilities can be overly confident even when the true probabilities are well-known.

This can occur due to lack of data, noise, or the presence of conflicting information and leads to incorrect predictions.

➊ Aleatoric uncertainty: due to inherent randomness in the data

➋ Epistemic uncertainty: due to the lack of knowledge or information about the model

➌ Model discrepancy: when the model's predictions are inconsistent with reality, which is a form of systematic error.

O͜͡ 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: adjusts the predicted probabilities to better align with the true class proportions. Two common calibration techniques are Platt scaling and isotonic regression.

O͜͡ 𝐁𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐧𝐞𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬: use probability distributions to model uncertainty in the weights of the neural network.

O͜͡ 𝐃𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: randomly drops out some neurons during training, which reduces overfitting and helps the model to generalize better.

O͜͡ 𝐄𝐧𝐬𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬: combine multiple models to improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty. 

O͜͡ 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐨 𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐨𝐮𝐭: uses dropout at inference time to obtain multiple predictions to estimate uncertainty.

O͜͡ 𝐃𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬: are similar to ensemble models, but they use different initializations and architectures to further reduce uncertainty.
