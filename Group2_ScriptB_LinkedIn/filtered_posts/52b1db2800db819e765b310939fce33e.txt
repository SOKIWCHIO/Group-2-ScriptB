Can AI earn clinicians’ trust? A new study says yes — if we rethink how uncertainty is measured.

A peer-reviewed Research Article in PLOS Digital Health (July 29, 2025) tested several Bayesian approaches to predicting prostate cancer–specific mortality using large-scale PLCO data. All models reached strong performance (AUROC = 0.86 in-distribution), but their ability to communicate when predictions should or should not be trusted varied widely.

The standout method was spectral-normalized neural Gaussian processes (SNGP), which use explicit, distance-aware Bayesian priors. This approach provided more reliable estimates of epistemic uncertainty than ensembles or variational Bayesian neural networks. By signaling uncertainty more faithfully, SNGP offers a safeguard against overconfidence in clinical decision support systems.

Why it matters: Personalized medicine depends on knowing not just what a model predicts, but how confident it is. This research points toward AI tools that can be both powerful and trustworthy in practice.
