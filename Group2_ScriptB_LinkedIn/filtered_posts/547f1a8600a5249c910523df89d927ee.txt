I am delighted to share our latest article on automatic segmentation of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A confidence score using deep ensembles is also proposed to quantify prediction uncertainty in order to automate the identification of complex cases that require further review. 

The results demonstrate the potential of attention-based architectures and specific preprocessing strategies to improve segmentation quality in such a challenging clinical scenario, while emphasizing the importance of uncertainty estimation to build trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging.

Kudos to our PhD candidate Sacha Dedeken for the exceptional work!

📣 We are excited to share our recent publication in Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, highlighting the groundbreaking work by LaTIM (Laboratory of Medical Information Processing) in collaboration with SOPHiA GENETICS to tackle the complexities of advanced lung cancer imaging.

Medical imaging is critical across the lung cancer patients’ journey, underscoring the need for robust, reliable, and automated radiomics segmentation tools to support clinical decision-making and improve patient care in advanced NSCLC.

🚀 In this study, the teams developed a high-performance, AI-driven tumor segmentation model, using a diverse, real-world imaging dataset, to advance both accuracy and trust in imaging analysis.
