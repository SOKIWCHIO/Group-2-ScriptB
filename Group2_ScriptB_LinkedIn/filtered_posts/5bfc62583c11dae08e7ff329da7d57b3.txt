Excited to share that I’ll be presenting our work “CBMA: Improving Conformal Prediction through Bayesian Model Averaging” at #ICLR2025 in Singapore!

Our paper explores how Bayesian Model Averaging can be combined with Conformal Prediction to produce more reliable and efficient prediction sets - a step forward in uncertainty quantification of ML models.

📌 If you're attending ICLR 2025, stop by my poster presentation to talk about:
- Bayesian perspectives on model uncertainty
- New insights in conformal prediction
- Potential applications in trustworthy and reliable AI

📍 Poster Session Info
 🗓️ Thursday, April 24  🕙 10:00 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. 
📌 Hall 3 + Hall 2B, Poster #426, Singapore EXPO

📝 Paper: https://lnkd.in/gwEZHsUD
 Authors: Pankaj Bhagwat, Linglong Kong, Bei Jiang
 Institution: University of Alberta

Thanks to the #ICLR community and reviewers for the feedback and support!

If you’re working on Bayesian inference, robust ML, or fairness & privacy in AI, let’s connect - I'm actively exploring applied collaborations in the space.

This is truly inspiring Pankaj Bhagwat  Dada... As someone like me who is passionate about Statistics, Bayesian Inference and ML your work on integrating CBMA with Conformal Prediction is fascinating and incredibly relevant... 
Wishing you all the best for your presentation at ICLR 2025...
Is there any way we can join or view the poster session online?
