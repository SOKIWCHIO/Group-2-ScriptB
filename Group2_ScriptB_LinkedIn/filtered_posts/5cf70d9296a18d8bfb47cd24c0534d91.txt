This was a very nice collaboration with the talented Dario Coscia. BARNN adds a layer of Bayesian uncertainty quantification around sequence models like RNNs. It achieves very good SOTA performance on both sequence prediction and uncertainty quantification for a number of tasks, among which PDE solving and molecule generation.

Presenting BARNN: https://lnkd.in/d2ZsSEe7. It’s a fully Bayesian, scalable, and calibrated approach to convert any Autoregressive or Recurrent Neural Network into its Bayesian counterpart with minimal training and architecture changes! 

BARNN combines the advantages given by Bayesian Inference with the great performances of autoregressive and recurrent nets! We applied it for Uncertainty Quantification in Neural PDE Solvers, and molecule generation in Chemical Language Models. Working done with Max Welling, Nicola Demo and Gianluigi Rozza.

Alexander Teeuwen perhaps for your next iteration?
