**NEW BMJ PAPER**
"Uncertainty of risk estimates from clinical prediction models: rationale, challenges, and approaches"
- most models provide just a risk estimate
- we argue for presenting associated uncertainty too
- includes pros, cons, PPIE & methods
Hope helpful!

In the evolving landscape of AI in healthcare, it's important that clinical prediction models not only provide predictions but also transparently quantify their uncertainty. This approach mirrors the real-world decision-making process of clinicians, who routinely assess probabilities and uncertainties in patient care. Embracing uncertainty reflects healthcare complexities and a step toward more reliable, human-centered AI applications in medicine.

It’s so true as a patient that you don’t get the full information.  Would be really interesting to look at GP data on risk score and then outcome.  To see if the model is right and if we can identify cohorts that differ from the model.
