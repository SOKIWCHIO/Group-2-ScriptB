Nastaran Darabi from AEON Lab will be presenting two papers at ICRA 2025 this week:
🔹 Paper 1: Calibrated Evidential Quantile Regression in Deep-Q Networks (CEQR-DQN)
 Authors: Alex Stutts, PhD, Danilo Erricolo, Theja Tulabandhula, Mohit Mittal (Meta), and Amit Trivedi
 We propose a new statistical learning framework that combines evidential deep learning with conformal quantile calibration to separately and efficiently estimate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in reinforcement learning. Tested on MinAtar, CEQR-DQN improves both learning speed and decision reliability under uncertainty.
 📌 Application: Safer and more sample-efficient exploration in mission-critical robotics.

🔹 Paper 2: Enhancing 3D Robotic Vision Robustness by Minimizing Adversarial Mutual Information
 Authors: Nastaran Darabi, Dinithi Jayasuriya, Devashri Naik, Theja Tulabandhula, and Amit Trivedi
 We introduce a curriculum-based adversarial training approach for 3D perception that minimizes mutual information under perturbation—without requiring adversarial samples. Our method improves generalization and robustness across point cloud models on ModelNet40 and KITTI datasets.
 📌 Application: Reliable 3D object detection in adversarial or noisy environments.
