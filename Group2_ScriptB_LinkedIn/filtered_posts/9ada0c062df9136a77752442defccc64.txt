Founder & CEO @ Dynamiq - Building AI Agents

🤖 LLM agents are undoubtedly one of the most exciting innovations in AI today. The potential they hold is immense, but bringing them into production environments is not without its challenges.

One of the most significant drawbacks is their lack of predictability and determinism in handling inputs and outputs. For businesses, this unpredictability is a red flag. Imagine entrusting your most critical tasks to a tool that might change its actions with just a slight variation in task definition. That’s a risk most businesses can't afford to take.

This unpredictability is precisely why industries like aviation avoid relying on neural networks or similar ML approaches. Safety-critical systems require absolute reliability, something that probabilistic models struggle to guarantee. 

LLMs, by design, are probabilistic - they predict the next token based on learned probabilities from their training data. While this approach works well in many scenarios, it poses a problem for tasks that demand consistency and reliability.

So, how do we address this? 🤔

One promising approach is incorporating structured text generation into key components of LLM agents, such as action planning. OpenAI's recent advancements in structured JSON generation are a step in the right direction, making LLM agents more predictable and reliable.

This should be combined with the development of comprehensive self-correcting loops within agents. It could include an agent-critic mechanism, where one agent's actions are scrutinized by another, helping to ensure more accurate and consistent outputs.

While LLM agents have come a long way, there’s still much work to be done to make them reliable tools for business-critical applications. By focusing on these areas, we can move closer to creating AI agents that businesses can trust. 

That's exactly the problem we spend countless days an
