I'm excited to announce that our paper "Enhanced Uncertainty Estimation in Ultrasound Image Segmentation with MSU-Net" has been accepted to the 5th International Workshop of Advances in Simplifying Medical UltraSound (ASMUS) at the #MICCAI2024 conference MICCAI Society! 🩺🌍

We propose MSU-Net, a multistage deep ensemble framework, designed to enhance femoral vessel segmentation in ultrasound images and quantify uncertainty, with the goal of providing autonomous guidance for phlebotomy tasks. 💉

Our recent study demonstrates that MSU-Net significantly outperforms traditional Monte Carlo U-Net approaches, offering:
✅ A parallelized deep learning framework for image segmentation
✅ 27.7% Improvement in the mean Dice Score Coefficient
✅ Statistically significant enhancement in sensitivity & false negative reduction
✅ Superior discrimination between correct and incorrect segmentations

All these advancements come with minimal additional training, highlighting MSU-Net's efficiency and effectiveness. 🚀 This has been the culmination of my research at the Auton Lab over the past several months and I am grateful for the opportunity to make an impact in this dynamic field! I am excited to begin my M.S. in Computer Science, continuing my research with the CMU Auton Lab @ Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science starting Fall 2024, advised by Professor Artur Dubrawski.
