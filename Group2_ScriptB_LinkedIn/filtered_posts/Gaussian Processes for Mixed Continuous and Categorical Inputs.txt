Title: Gaussian Processes for Mixed Continuous and Categorical Inputs

Content:
I am dealing with mixed categorical/continuous inputs where uncertainty is key, thus Gaussian Processes would be a great model.

Is anyone aware of a python library where I could use such mixed inputs with GPs, and potentially define my own kernels for each? Or will I have to implement it from scratch?

Thank you
