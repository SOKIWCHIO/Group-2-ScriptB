Title: Simulating a single human neuron.

Content:
So IBM has developed a "Neurosynaptic Core" chip to facilitate building learning machines / neural nets in response to a DARPA challenge to develop "biological scale" neural networks.

IBM's feat is 500 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses.  The DARPA target is to achieve 10^10 neurons and 10^14 synapses.

A human brain, as I understand it, is about 10^11 neurons and 10^15 synapses.

One of my main questions is... how much "computing" can one real human neuron do?  

If you wanted to simulate a real human, how much information do you need to encode in software terms to simulate how a single neuron would respond to signals across the thousands of synapses that neuron would have in a real brain?  

Moreover, are there different kinds of signals that might come down a single synapse?  If so, has signal variety been enumerated in any way yet?

Really, I'm asking how "smart" is a single brain cell and how complex a task is it to even simulate the behavior and versatility of just one?

- Read this: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00083
- In /r/neuralnetworks, /u/D1zz1 references these two articles:

* http://www.human-memory.net/brain_neurons.html
* http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2014.00086/full

The first one points out that that there are numerous dimensions of complexity in the way that signals are processed (such as half a dozen chemical neurotransmitters which activate in different circumstances to modulate how signals are processed across a synapse.  It also hints at synapse strengths, and how synapses evolve over time).

A general question about neurotransmitters -- do they tend to trigger locally (single synapse) and on the time scale of individual electrical signals or are they more of a brain-wide or region-wide expression over long time periods (like a few seconds or even minutes of time)?
