Title: What questions do data-literate professionals ask?

Content:
e.g. 

- Where does the data come from and how was it collected? How reliable or "noisy" is the data (e.g. measurement error, missingness, etc.)?
- What is the larger population we are inferring from the sample?

- What are the inherent trade-offs (e.g. bias vs. variance) to the methods used to interpret this data?

- What's the level of uncertainty with a given model's predictions (e.g. standard errors, confidence intervals, etc.? How do I know when my inference is wrong?

- Have your findings been replicated? If not, do you have the data and programming scripts so that another data scientist could attempt to replicate your results?

Comments:
- I agree with /u/Divisible-by-zero

For me, everything is domain knowledge, then process knowledge, then exceptions with the process, THEN I myself can infer the uncertainty etc.
