**Topics of interest include but not limited to:**

• Model uncertainty estimation and calibration

• Robustness to distribution shift and out-of-distribution generalization

• Anomaly detection and out-of-distribution detection

• Probabilistic (Bayesian and non-Bayesian) neural networks

• Model misspecification

• Quantifying different types of uncertainty (known unknowns, unknown unknowns, contextual anomalies, ambiguities)

• Open world recognition and open set learning

• Connections between out-of-distribution generalization and adversarial robustness

• New datasets and protocols for evaluating uncertainty and robustness
