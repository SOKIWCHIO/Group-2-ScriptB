Comments:
- Can we attend without submitting papers? I don't see any registration page.
- Epic
- I think you are just supposed to register for ICML 2021, and I'm not sure if there is a way to attend otherwise, such as a Zoom link on our workshop website on the day it happens.
- Update: If registration is prohibitive, some content (including keynote lectures) will be available on the website for all to access on the day of the workshop.
