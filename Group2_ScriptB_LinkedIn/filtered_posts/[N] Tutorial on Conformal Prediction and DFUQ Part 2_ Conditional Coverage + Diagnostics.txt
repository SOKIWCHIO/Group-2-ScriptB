Title: [N] Tutorial on Conformal Prediction and DFUQ Part 2: Conditional Coverage + Diagnostics

Content:
Hey everyone!

  We just posted Part 2 of our Tutorial on Conformal Prediction and Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification on YouTube!

  [https://youtu.be/TRx4a2u-j7M](https://youtu.be/TRx4a2u-j7M)

  It focuses on conditional coverage and diagnostics to make sure your conformal procedure is working properly. It's slightly more advanced than the last one, but will leave you with a strong understanding of how to implement/evaluate conformal in code.

  Let us know if you have any feedback by shooting me an email :)

Best,

Anastasios
