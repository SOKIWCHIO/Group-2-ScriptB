Comments:
- Calling that a generous stipend is criminal. PhD students are aware that stipends are usually quite low, and are often willing to accommodate regardless. There's no need to gaslight people like this.
- Very less pay

- Thank you for your comment. Our use of the term "generous" reflects a direct comparison with typical PhD scholarships offered by public institutions, such as Victoria University of Wellington and the Australian National University. Our scholarship indeed provides a higher stipend than many university-funded programs, includes coverage for travel expensesâ€”which are typically not includedâ€”and offers an option for extension, a benefit rarely available in standard university scholarships.

Additionally, our stipend is tax-free and imposes no mandatory work obligations, unlike certain scholarships from other countries or institutions that require recipients to engage in teaching or tutoring responsibilities. We acknowledge that stipends in academia generally cannot compete financially with industry positions, especially in high-cost regions such as Silicon Valley. However, within the context of academic research scholarships, our offering is comparatively generous.

We appreciate your perspective and feedback and are certainly not attempting to diminish the experiences or expectations of PhD students. If the wording has caused offense, that was not our intention, and we will carefully consider how best to communicate our scholarship's benefits clearly and respectfully in the future.
