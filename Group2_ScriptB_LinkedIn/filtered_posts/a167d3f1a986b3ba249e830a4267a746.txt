And here we have a perfect example of #ignorance around #AI

"Here's what your tech team isn't telling you: Large Language Models are brilliant prediction engines, not thinking machines. They excel at pattern-matching from vast datasets, generating convincing responses by predicting what should come next. But prediction is not understanding. Statistics are not intelligence. And scaling up prediction will never, by itself, create the kind of artificial general intelligence that could truly transform your business.."

Fools with tools are still fools.  

Successful integration requires knowing how to apply the right tools appropriately for selective tasks.  Don't make blanket policy imposing the use of AI, especially when you don't know how to use AI yourself.  Work with the talent in the organization and ask how existing tools, AI or other, can improve quality and productivity.  Do meaningful pilots.
