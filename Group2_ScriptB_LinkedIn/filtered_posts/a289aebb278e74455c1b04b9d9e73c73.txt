Machine learning sucks at uncertainty quantification.

But there is a solution that almost sounds too good to be true: 

conformal prediction

• works for any black box model
• requires few lines of code
• is fast
• comes with statistical guarantees

A thread 🧵


Conformal prediction is a method for uncertainty quantification of machine learning models.

The method takes a heuristic uncertainty score and turns it into a rigorous one.



What confused me first about conformal prediction: It's not 1 algorithm, but a general recipe:

• Split data: training and calibration
• Train model
• Calculate "heuristic" scores on calibration data
• Calibrate score
• Use calibrated scoring rule on new data


The recipe enables many use cases:

• Prediction sets in multi-class problems
• Calibrate classification scores so they can be interpreted as probabilities
• Fix coverage of quantile regression
• Conformal predictive distributions for regression
• ...


How to get started with conformal prediction:

• scikit-ready Python package: https://lnkd.in/eXx-a-aK
• R package: https://lnkd.in/eF7puN2D

A fundamental problem with conformal prediction is that it is a marginal interval -- the confidence is an average across all X's. In practice, one needs conditional prediction intervals, valid for a given x. That's what practitio
