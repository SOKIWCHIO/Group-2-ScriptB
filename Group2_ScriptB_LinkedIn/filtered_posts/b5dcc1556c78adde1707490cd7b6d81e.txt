Ever wonder how machine learning models quantify uncertainty in predictions? In high-stakes scenarios like healthcare and finance, knowing how confident your model is can be just as important as the prediction itself.

Day 15: Machine Learning Interview Questions
What is the difference between Softmax and Sigmoid functions, and when would you use each?

Answer:
Both Softmax and Sigmoid functions are activation functions used to transform the output of a model into probabilities, but they are applied in different scenarios.


Sigmoid Function:
    Range: Outputs a value between 0 and 1.
    Formula:   Sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))

Use Case:
The sigmoid function is typically used in binary classification problems, where the output needs to be interpreted as a probability for one of two classes (e.g., 0 or 1). It maps the output of the model to a probability score, making it ideal for logistic regression or binary classification tasks.


Softmax Function:
    Range: Outputs values between 0 and 1 for each class, and the sum of all output probabilities equals 1.
    Formula:
Softmax(z)_i = exp(z_i) / Σ(exp(z_j)) for each class i

Use Case:
Softmax is used in multi-class classification problems, where you want to assign probabilities to multiple classes. It’s often used as the final activation function in models like neural networks for problems with more than two classes. It ensures that the predicted probabilities for all classes sum to 1.
