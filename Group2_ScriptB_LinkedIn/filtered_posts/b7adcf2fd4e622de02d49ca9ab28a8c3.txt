I recently successfully defended my PhD thesis on “Uncertainty Estimation for Independent and Non-Independent Data” viva and the manuscript is now available online :)

Check it out if you want to learn about uncertainty estimation for image, tabular, graph, sequential data and more!

Uncertainty estimation is critical for both practical and theoretical reasons. The intro chapters present motivations, concepts, and terminology which are key to quickly jump into the field.

In my thesis, I discuss desiderata, models, and metrics for uncertainty estimation for different input and output data types that can be found in the real world:

- Uncertainty Estimation for Classification (Ch.3)
- Uncertainty Estimation for Regression (Ch.4)
- Practicality of Uncertainty Estimation (Ch.5)
- Robustness Uncertainty Estimation (Ch.6)
- Uncertainty Estimation for Graph Data (Ch.8)
- Uncertainty Estimation for Sequential Data (Ch.9)
- Uncertainty Estimation for Reinforcement Learning (Ch.10)

These chapters are accompanied with retrospective and promising future directions for uncertainty estimation in ML. I hope that people will enjoy!

Thanks a lot to my supervisor Pr. Stephan Günnemann, my examiners Pr. Eyke Hüllermeier & Pr. Eric Nalisnick, my coauthors, and everyone who supported me in this research! This would not have been possible without them :)
