Hi traders! 👋

In data-driven methods, uncertainty arises from:
-The intrinsic ambiguity in the data
-Variations in sampling
-Flawed models
-Errors in model approximations

Even in rule-based or symbolic ML systems, the complexity of the market introduces uncertainty, affecting any conclusions drawn.

Addressing uncertainty is crucial not as a theoretical idea but as a practical requirement, as #trading systems must generate profit despite working with imperfect information. For now, the most effective way I have found to use total uncertainty is by:
-Modeling it to switch-off the system
-Iniciating a process of optimization
-Metric of quality performance
-Filtering and assets selection

To understand it, a quick reminder of some concepts:
-Aleatoric-statistical uncertainty: What will a random sample drawn from a probability distribution be?
-Epistemic-systematic uncertainty: What is the relevant probability distribution?
-Total uncertainty: The sum of aleatoric and epistemic when both of them are independent

The basic protocol is based on:
PnL → Conformal prediction → Switch-off (or optimization)

Some considerations:
-Although robust and stochastic optimization methods are often used to handle optimization under Bayesian uncertainty, they don’t effectively predict epistemic uncertainty with sufficient accuracy
-By integrating models that account for epistemic uncertainty, we can improve the optimization process by considering the gaps in information or data
-It is necessary to change the typical CP method to fit into this phase of the system development
-The rule is simple: If PnL < Lower interval: Switch-off, else: continue
