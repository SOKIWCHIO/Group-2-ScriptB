🚀 Introducing ML-Uncertainty 1.0.0 🚀 

ML uncertainty is a Python package that provides a scikit-learn-like interface to enable users quantify uncertainty in machine learning models and generate prediction intervals for predictions in less than 4 lines of code.

This package is designed to add interpretability and robustness to your ML workflows by make uncertainty estimation more accessible and seamless.

🌟 Key Features:
✅ Works for linear and non-linear regression models as well as random forest models
✅ Works with multivariate input data
✅ Model training can be performed with scikit-learn as usual; ML-uncertainty works on top of scikit-learn.
✅ Provides uncertainties in parameter estimates in regression tasks

🔗 Get Started:
👉 Install with: pip install ml-uncertainty
👉 PyPI: https://lnkd.in/d-JxXXg9
👉 GitHub repo: https://lnkd.in/dMpb4XDZ
👉 Examples:  https://lnkd.in/dsxzUMGA

Please give it a try. Looking forward to your thoughts.

How do the methods in this package compare to those available in the MAPIE library? https://mapie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
