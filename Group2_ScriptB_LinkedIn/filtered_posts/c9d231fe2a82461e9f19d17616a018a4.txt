Ok, let's clarify this once and for all. LLMs are neither stochastic nor probabilistic. An LLM is a mathematical formula that is perfectly deterministic. You send the same value to the input, and you get the same list of scores at the output. Just because you decide to toss a coin based on these scores doesn't make the LLM stochastic. A coin is not stochastic; you just decide to make a decision by tossing it. Don’t toss, and nothing will change.

Andriy, interesting perspective. I may have misunderstood but isn't that true for any model? Once the training is complete, the trained model is deterministic.

Wait.. hmm, what happened to temperature and top P values..? I thought that made the LLMs produce random values

Respectfully disagree Andriy Burkov. If you "don't toss" you will not get intelligence. It's a rich irony IMO.

There are lots of "formulas" to build LLMs, and none of the ones I know are deterministic. Transformers typically start with random weights, and have a temperature setting to pick stochastically/probabilistically among a token distribution. They *evolved* from deterministic to stochastic because deterministic LLMs wrote boring, repetitive, unintelligent and often unintelligible text.

Agreed. It’s interesting to note though that the temperature parameter, which is user defined and determines the lev
