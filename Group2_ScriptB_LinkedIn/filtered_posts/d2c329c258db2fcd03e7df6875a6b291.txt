In 2019, with two undergraduates interns in my group, we started exploring the idea of identifying governing equations for manufacturing systems using machine learning. Specifically, we worked on SINDy and Sym Reg (Symbolic regression) applications on widely used distillation column in chemical processes. This was fascinating to explore very early on, there were many more open questions than answers and we found some interesting results on mechanism elucidation. We published it in Machine Learning Applications as back then, journals of chemical engineering and manufacturing were skeptical about the idea and we got desk rejected. Recently, lot of other researchers have started using these techniques as well, which is a good sign for chemical engineering community  to ensure that machine learning applications are developed with domain specific knowledge and for domain applications. #UGresearch RAGHAV MOAR Renganathan Subramanian #MachineLearning #ProcessSystemsEngineering
