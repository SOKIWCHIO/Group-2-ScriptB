📢 New Blog Post Alert
We are excited to share our latest blog post: "Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification" based on the corresponding paper (https://lnkd.in/eaSyxx-b) by Kumar Manas, Christian Schlauch, Prof. Dr. Adrian Paschke, Dr. Christian Wirth, and Prof. Dr. Nadja Klein, published at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025.

Introducing SHIFT, a novel training framework that tackles one of autonomous driving's biggest challenges: reliable motion prediction with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

🔍 Key innovations include:
- Automatic rule extraction using Large Language Models with RAG for scalable prior knowledge integration
- Heteroscedastic Gaussian processes for better aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty modeling
- Two-stage training where "today's posterior becomes tomorrow's prior"
- Spectral-normalized ResNet-50 backbone for distance-sensitive representations

Our experiments demonstrate that SHIFT consistently outperforms baselines across standard training, low-data regimes, and out-of-distribution scenarios. The latter is especially crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Our framework shows how combining domain expertise (drivability rules, traffic regulations) with principled uncertainty quantification can achieve higher performance with less data.
