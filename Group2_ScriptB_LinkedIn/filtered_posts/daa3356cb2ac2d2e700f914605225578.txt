418 pages of Probabilistic AI gold just dropped!

Easily one of the best courses I've attended at ETH, taught by Andreas Krause. 
These notes cover all the essentials: aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty, Gaussian Processes, MCMC methods, Active Learning, Bayesian Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and more.

Truly grateful this amazing resource is now available to the community!

•	Epistemic Uncertainty: Stemming from limited data or knowledge, this uncertainty can be reduced by acquiring more information.
	•	Aleatoric Uncertainty: Inherent variability or noise in observations and outcomes, which remains irreducible regardless of additional data.

Data is key to outputs of AI and game changer is agentic AI with correct data

More than just the technical matter, this is a great resource for younger researchers to learn how to write things well, and clearly. Andreas is, and always has been, a beautiful, beautiful technical writer.

The integration of Bayesian optimization in AI systems, as highlighted in this manuscript, exemplifies a sophisticated approach to handling uncertainty, thereby enhancing decision-making capabilities in sequential tasks.
