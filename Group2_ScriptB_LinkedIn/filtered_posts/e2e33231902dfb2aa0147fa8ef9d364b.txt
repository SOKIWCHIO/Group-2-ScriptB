🎧 AI Meets Quantum Mechanics: A New Way to Understand Meaning in Language Models

Simplified Podcast: https://lnkd.in/gt6CGc83

Can we understand meaning and probabilities with words in LLM's in Artificial Intelligence the way physicists understand particles and wave dynamic probabilities in quantum mechanics?

A fascinating new paper by Timo Aukusti Laine (linked below) proposes just that—treating words in Large Language Models (LLMs) as quantum-like states in a "semantic space." It introduces the idea of a semantic wave function that captures not just the strength of a word’s meaning, but also its phase—how it aligns or interferes with other meanings.

🔹 In AI, neural nets generate language using probabilistic next-word prediction.
 🔹 In quantum mechanics, wave functions calculate probabilities of where particles might be.
 🔹 What if both systems share deeper mathematical patterns?

The article below explores:
LLMs as quantized semantic spaces, built from discrete tokens (like energy levels)

How complex numbers (vs. real ones) better reflect subtle meaning shifts

Semantic interference (why irony, ambiguity, or hallucinations emerge)

And even potential "semantic landscapes" to model context and choice

📘 The full paper is complex and at Ph.D's levels but available for review here:

🎙 Prefer to listen to something simpler and learn more about the topic with an easier longer introduction through a conversation between two hosts in NotebookLM breaking down the Ph.D. topic to a Masters level - not completely simplified but worth struggling through? This podcast  https://lnkd.in/gt6CGc83   walks through the key ideas in a more compelling, interdisciplinary forma
