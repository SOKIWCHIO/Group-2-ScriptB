This year, our Health-X lab (healthx-lab.ca) will have a number of presentations on various perspectives of medical AI research at MICCAI 2023 and the satellite events. Our trainees and I look forward to discussing our works with you in the next one week in Vancouver!

*Main conference:
In Oral Session 4 (M-01-047)on October 9th, PhD trainee Soorena Salari will present: 
FocalErrorNet: Uncertainty-aware focal modulation network for inter-modal registration error estimation in ultrasound-guided neurosurgery
https://lnkd.in/eBZ-sjiZ

In Poster Session (M-01-131) on October 9th, PhD trainee Soorena Salari will present: 
Towards multi-modal anatomical landmark detection for ultrasound-guided brain tumor resection with contrastive learning
https://lnkd.in/e-TnmHX9

* MICCAI Machine Learning in Clinical Neuroimaging (MLCN) workshop:
During the oral session on Oct 8, PhD trainee Mumu Aktar will present:  
VesselShot: Few-shot learning for cerebral blood vessel segmentation
https://lnkd.in/e9NYtmTV

* MICCAI Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI) workshop:
During the poster session on Oct 8, MSc trainee Zirui Qiu will present:
Is visual explanation with Grad-CAM more reliability for deeper neural networks? a case study with automatic pneumothorax diagnosis
https://lnkd.in/exifsS9T

* MICCAI UNSURE workshop:
During the oral session on Oct 12, MSc trainee Parinaz Roshanzamir will present:
How inter-rater variability relates to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty: a case study with deep learning-based paraspinal muscle segmentation
https://lnkd.in/eQMdZdkQ

We thank all the collaborators for their contributions to these works!
