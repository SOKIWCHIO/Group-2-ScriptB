Two important concepts for quantifying the uncertainty in machine learning predictions: confidence intervals and conformal predictions. I
n my experience, they are often mixed up (for instance, when I share results or resources including confidence intervals, I get recommendations to use conformal predictions). 

Confidence intervals are for quantifying the certainty of an estimate. Conformal predictions are for point estimates, to create prediction intervals -- the confidence around a given prediction.

In papers, we typically report confidence intervals around the prediction accuracy. And in praxis, we may use conformal predictions to capture the uncertainty of the model prediction. For classifiers, this is a set of labels such that the set contains labels with a given confidence.

Both approaches are useful, but they address different use cases.

In case you are curious about creating confidence intervals for ML models, I have an article describing the 4 different approaches here: https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/confidence-intervals-for-ml.html 

For conformal predictions, Christoph Molnar has a nice series of posts here: https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/e-mail-course-on-conformal-prediction
