👨🏫 In high-stakes applications like medical diagnostics and industrial AI, understanding and quantifying uncertainty in ML models is crucial to prevent critical failures. 

🌟Join us in welcoming Mahdi Torabi Rad, the President of MLBoost Videos, as he delivers workshop on "Uncertainty Quantification with Conformal Prediction: Ensuring the Trustworthiness of ML Models". Mahdi's workshop will dive into Conformal Prediction, a robust approach that provides distribution-free validity and explicit guarantees without relying on specific data distributions or model assumptions.

🎯 Key Insights You'll Gain:
- What sets conformal prediction apart from other uncertainty quantification methods?
- The foundation behind conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in ML.
- Creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals using conformal prediction.
- Applying conformal prediction to pre-trained models like neural networks.
- Real-world examples with Python code samples and Jupyter notebooks.
- Use cases in financial forecasting, NLP, and computer vision.

About Mahdi Torabi Rad:
Mahdi is a computational scientist, engineer, and YouTube content creator with over 10 years of experience in developing ML models and computer codes for predicting complex phenomena. He is the ML Lead at various DeepTech startups and runs the popular YouTube channel MLBoost, where his videos on ML topics, including Conformal Prediction, have garnered tens of thousands of views.
