Great to have presented our work at #AISTATS2025
 last week! Thanks to everyone for the insightful discussions. We hope our contributions to uncertainty quantification (UQ) prove helpful.

🔬 Our paper provides theoretical insights into two metrics for evaluating uncertainty in binary classifiers. We show that maximizing these metrics yields scores that allow for controlling the misclassification error and the disagreement with the Bayes optimal classifier, respectively.

⚙️ Our experiments also demonstrate that these easy-to-compute metrics correlate well with more costly, annotation-heavy alternatives.

Why does this matter? As ML systems become more prevalent, especially in critical applications like healthcare, understanding when our models are uncertain is essential for safe and reliable deployment. However, uncertainty estimation is complex and challenging to validate. By providing theoretically grounded metrics to evaluate the utility of uncertainty estimators, our findings aim to pave the way for broader adoption of UQ in deep learning applications.
