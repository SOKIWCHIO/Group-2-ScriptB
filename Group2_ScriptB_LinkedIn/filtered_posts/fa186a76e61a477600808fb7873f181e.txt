Scientific ML for Everyone

Most people do this when trying to learn machine learning:

Step 1 - Watch a few tutorials
Step 2 - Build a Titanic survivor predictor
Step 3 - Add “ML Expert” to their LinkedIn bio

Here’s the uncomfortable truth:
Toy Kaggle projects will not take you far. Especially if you're an engineer, scientist, or economist trying to apply ML to your actual field.

How does MNIST digit recognition help a mechanical engineer working on heat transfer?
How does movie recommendation connect to a structural engineer designing buildings?

It doesn’t.

The gap is clear - there are ML experts and there are domain experts.
But very few people live at the intersection.

That’s where Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) comes in.

SciML is not about throwing data at black-box models.
It’s about blending mathematical models with learning algorithms.
It’s about making AI work in the real world of physics, finance, biology, climate, and more.

Here’s what makes SciML powerful:

👉 Uses your existing knowledge (ODEs, PDEs, control systems)

👉 Leverages neural networks as universal function approximators

👉 Keeps models interpretable, efficient, and domain-relevant

You don’t need a CS degree to do this.
I was a core mechanical engineer. I didn’t take any formal CS courses. And yet, I work on SciML every day.

Why? Because ML is being democratized. And SciML is the proof.

If you want to stop playing with toy problems and start working on impactful ML research rooted in your domain, this is your path.

Let’s stop pretending Titanic prediction is enough.
Let’s build ML that actually matters.
