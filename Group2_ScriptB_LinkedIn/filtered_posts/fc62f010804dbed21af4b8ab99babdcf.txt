I am happy to share, that our latest work "OCCUQ: Exploring Efficient Uncertainty Quantification for 3D Occupancy Prediction" has been accepted to #ICRA2025 !

📕 Paper: https://lnkd.in/ex2ixigZ

3D Occupancy Prediction has become a very active field in robotics and AI, but can we actually trust these predictions ?

We propose an adaptation of an efficient uncertainty estimation
technique to disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty for voxel-wise occupancy predictions. This allows us to dynamically calibrate model confidences, enhancing safety by handling adverse conditions (snow, sensor failures, etc.) and by providing uncertainty indicators for rare or unseen objects. Our approach outperforms standard baselines, offering more reliable and robust 3d occupancy predictions.

We will be presenting our findings at ICRA, the world's leading robotics conference, this May in Atlanta. 🤖

A big shout out to Severin Heidrich. His thesis provided the foundation for this work. Special thanks to Alexey Nekrasov for his excellent contribution and guidance in this work. We acknowledge the AIthena project for funding this research.
