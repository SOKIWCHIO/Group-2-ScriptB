would you rather opt for deep neural network with limited interpretability or a deep Bayesian neural network that quantifies uncertainty??

the latter, being based on Bayesian principles, offers a more comprehensive approach to decision making under uncertainty and the ability to incorporate prior knowledge into the model.🔥🔥😉😉

furthermore, probabilistic modeling is a fundamental language used in various branches of science and engineering, providing a framework for interdisciplinary collaboration.

otherwise I'm willing to listen to your options 🤔😇

The main limitation of deep Bayesian neural networks is the computational cost associated with performing Bayesian inference. Inference in Bayesian neural networks typically requires approximations, such as variational inference or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which can be computationally expensive. These methods also can be relatively slow, which can make it impractical for certain real-time applications. Additionally, the interpretability of Bayesian neural networks can actually be lower than that of traditional deep neural networks. The uncertainty information provided by the Bayesian model can be difficult to understand and interpret for non-experts.

Basically it's not really a choice between the two, you need to consider more requirements about what you're trying to solve - latency, compute, cost, users, etc.
