Imagine you want to model a dynamical system and wish to take into account the uncertainty. Two approaches come to my mind. We can use stochastic differential equations or we can stick to ODEs but assume the uncertainty over coefficients and boundary values. 

I was thinking about this for a bit and so far I think the motivation behind Bayesian ODEs is modeling epistemic uncertainty while SDEs are better in representing aleatoric uncertainty. However, beside this difference, Bayesian ODEs seem more flexible.

What do you think?

Interesting! In terms of generative models, flow matching corresponds to the ODE with stochastic initial condition, while SDEs match with denoising diffusion models. In both cases, the main aim is to model aleatoric uncertainty.

Few relevant examples on Bayesian ODEs/SDEs:

Interesting topic! My opinion: it depends on what system you want to model and what resources you have. 

For modeling uncertainty where stochastic noise or random fluctuations are critical to system behavior, Bayesian SDEs are bett
