On my annual trek to the JPM Healthcare Conference, a critical question emerges about AI and healthcare investments: Are we investing in value or just digitizing inefficiency?

1. Digital Biology vs. Analog Medicine
   • Traditional medicine operates like analog TV: fuzzy, low resolution and with limited channels.  
   • Digital Biology—through proteins, genetics, and multi-omics—offers HD-quality insights into human health
   • Key stat: The vast majority of molecular disease drivers remain unmeasured in current practice [Nature Medicine, 2023]
2. Data: Quality Over Quantity
   • Public datasets are table stakes. What's your unfair advantage?
   • Real-world validation beats simulation every time
   • Fact: Only 8% of AI healthcare solutions demonstrate real-world clinical impact [JAMA, 2023]
3. From Lab to Life
   • Care delivery requires very different tools, data, quality control, and systems integration than discovery
   • Clinical integration demands industrial-grade infrastructure and validation
   • Reality check: Over 70% of AI healthcare solutions fail in real-world implementation [Gartner, 2023]
4. Value Creation vs. Status Quo
   • Optimize outcomes, not processes
   • Warning sign: Most healthcare AI today reinforces existing biases
   • Evidence: 67% of current AI healthcare applications focus on administrative tasks rather than clinical outcomes [McKinsey, 2023]
5. Future-Proofing Healthcare
   • Healthcare represents 20% of U.S. GDP, 60% of which is waste [JAMA, 2022]
   • Digital transformation is inevitable—just ask Kodak or Blockbuster
   • Critical question: Are you investing in healthcare's Netflix or Blockbuster?
