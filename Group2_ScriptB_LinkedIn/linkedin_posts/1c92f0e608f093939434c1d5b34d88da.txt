Senior AI Engineer • Founder @ Decoding ML ~ Building an army of AI agents and teaching you about the process.

5 个月

One of the least talked about (yet most critical) parts of GenAI systems?

Evaluating LLMs and RAG in production.

And on May 15th, I'll dive deep into it during a live virtual workshop I'll be hosting at 𝗢𝗗𝗦𝗖 𝗕𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗻.

If you've ever shipped an LLM-powered product, you already know:

→ Retrieval fails silently
→ LLM outputs can sound right but be totally wrong
→ Traditional ML metrics like accuracy, BLEU, or ROGUE aren’t enough
→ And user feedback? Rare, subjective, and hard to act on

That’s why this session will focus on how to make evaluation systematic:

→ When to use human vs. LLM judges
→ How to evaluate agentic applications
→ Designing test sets that reflect real-world workflows
→ Building CI-like pipelines for eval that run before (and after) deploy
→ Tools and templates you can steal for your own stack

Whether you’re fine-tuning models or building end-to-end agentic apps—this is the foundation most teams are missing.

If Agentic systems are part of your roadmap, this workshop will help you make sure they’re production-grade.

📍 Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) Boston (Virtual)

📌 Question:

This is a shift in how to approach learning. Rather than counting “how much I’ve read or done” think in terms of “how many concepts can I actually remember and use”. 

What do you think?

Yo this workshop sounds epic! Anyone else struggling with those sneaky LLM failures in prod? The eval game is seriously next level now
