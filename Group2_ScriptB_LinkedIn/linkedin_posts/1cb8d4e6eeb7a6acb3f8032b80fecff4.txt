→ Dealing with Uncertainty
In real-world scenarios, data is noisy and incomplete. Probability provides a framework to handle this uncertainty.

→ Making Predictions
Machine learning models often predict probabilities instead of exact values. For instance, a classification model might say:
“The email is 90% likely to be spam.”

→ Learning from Data
Many algorithms (like Naive Bayes and Bayesian Networks) rely on probabilistic principles to learn relationships within data.

→ Random Variables
A variable whose value depends on outcomes of a random phenomenon (e.g., weather).

→ Probability Distributions
Describes how likely each outcome is. Common ones in ML include:
↳ Normal Distribution: Many natural phenomena follow this bell-shaped curve.
↳ Bernoulli Distribution: Used for binary outcomes (e.g., coin flips).

→ Conditional Probability
Represents the probability of an event, given that another event has occurred. Example:
P(A|B) = Probability of A, given B.

→ Bayes’ Theorem
A foundational formula in ML:
 P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} 
It’s used in algorithms like Naive Bayes for classification.

→ Naive Bayes Classifier
Applies Bayes’ theorem for text classification (e.g., spam detection).

→ Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
Used for sequence data, such as speech recognition and time-series predictions.

→ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
Model data points as a mixture of multiple normal distributions.

→ Reinforcement Learning
Relies on probabilities to model rewards and actions in uncertain environments.

→ Dropout in Neural Networks
Uses probabilities to randomly deactivate neurons, preventing overfitting.

→ Probabilistic Models
