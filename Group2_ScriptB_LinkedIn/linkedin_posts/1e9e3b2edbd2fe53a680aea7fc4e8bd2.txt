This week, ICRA 2022 is happening in Philadelphia, USA. It's very unfortunate that I can not be there in person to present my work. However, I will be presenting my work remotely. I will be presenting the work I did during my masters at Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute. 

In this work, We propose f-Cal, a variational calibration method to obtain trustworthy estimates of aleatoric uncertainty from neural networks. What if you want to deploy an object detection or depth estimation model on your self-driving car? How do you know that your model can be trusted with the job it's expected to do?

In this work, we delve into these questions and propose a method to get trustworthy uncertainty estimates of what our model predicts. These uncertainty estimates can be used for variety of downstream tasks ranging from motion planning to sensor fusion. We show efficacy of f-Cal by reporting results on a toy dataset, as well as real-world computer vision tasks such as object detection and depth estimation.

Work co-led with Kaustubh Mani, and ably supported by Dishank Bansal, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula, Lee Hanju and Liam Paull.
