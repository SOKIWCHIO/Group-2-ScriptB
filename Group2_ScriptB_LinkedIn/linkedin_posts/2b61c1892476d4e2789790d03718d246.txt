📊 Exploring Architectural and Inferential Inductive Biases in Exchangeable Sequence Modeling 📊

Recent advancements in autoregressive models have highlighted their efficacy in modeling exchangeable sequences, particularly when addressing i.i.d. observations conditioned on latent factors. This approach offers a robust framework for quantifying uncertainty arising from missing data, rather than relying solely on latent variables.

The critical role of posterior inference in decision-making processes—such as active learning and bandit problems—has prompted an investigation into the most effective inductive biases for exchangeable sequence modeling. A significant limitation of the conventional single-step generation method is its inability to differentiate between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

In contrast, a multi-step autoregressive generation approach has been advocated within Bayesian statistics, demonstrating enhanced uncertainty quantification that translates into improved performance on downstream decision-making tasks.

Furthermore, an analysis of recent Transformer architectures reveals a notable gap; these models may fail to guarantee exchangeability while incurring substantial computational costs. Controlled synthetic experiments illustrate that custom architectures can significantly underperform standard causal masks, emphasizing the urgent need for innovative architectural solutions.
