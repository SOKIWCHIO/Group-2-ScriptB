The #1 mistake with LLMs : using them as databases. Let me explain : 

LLMs aren’t database, and you should never use them as such.

When you ask a LLM to “retrieve” data for you, it won’t. Rather, it will answer you something that’s probable, given the data it’s been shown. 

That’s because LLMs are a probabilistic model of data, not the data itself. Their answers are a set of probabilistic tuples of the tables involved in your database, not your data.

This is great news though! 

Probabilistic models of data are much more useful than the data itself - they are a flexible abstraction that can be used to classify, generate and do many useful things that were almost impossible not so long ago. 

You just have to choose your use-case carefully. 
 
In my experience the most impactful applications of LLMs are often on the backend, integrated into systems, doing data processing - without being visible to the user.

That's a nice way to see it.

The "memory" part of the LLM is a probabilistic representation of the training set facts.

This probabilistic representation are what we can call "wisdom", the LLM created and recognized there own pattern.

With their own bias.
Like a human.
