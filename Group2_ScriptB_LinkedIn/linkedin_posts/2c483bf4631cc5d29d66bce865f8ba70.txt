David Stutz

Research scientist at Google DeepMind

3 年

Last week I finally defended my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics and Universität des Saarlandes / Saarland Informatics Campus. Got a great hat with lots of adversarial example and DeepMind references from my colleagues.

Stay tuned for the whole thesis covering my work on adversarial robustness, uncertainty estimation and OOD detection, conformal prediction and bit error robustness for deep learning accelerators. Get a slightly outdated, short overview here: https://lnkd.in/eQDg7CMY

Special thanks to my advisors Bernt Schiele and Matthias Hein (University of Tuebingen) as well as my committee Pawan Kumar, Mario Fritz, Eddy Ilg and Jan Eric Lenssen.

It was also a pleasure to work with great collaborators: Nandhini Chandramoorthy (IBM Research), Ali Taylan Cemgil, Arnaud Doucet, Krishnamurthy Dvijotham (all DeepMind or Google AI).
