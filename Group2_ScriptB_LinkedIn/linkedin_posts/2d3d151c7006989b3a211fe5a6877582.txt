Last week, I had the opportunity to present my research on uncertainty estimation in LiDAR scene perception at the PhD Colloquium DGK-Geoinfo 2025 in Bonn.

I shared how we use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to model epistemic uncertainty and detect out-of-distribution samples. In addition, I presented our approach to quantifying aleatoric uncertainty when classifying LiDAR point clouds—gaining valuable feedback for future improvements.

🎥 The short video below showcases a Bird’s Eye View (BEV) of the LiDAR scene interpretation:
The left side shows the model's predictions, where different objects are visualized in distinct colors—for example, the street is highlighted in pink.
The right side displays our uncertainty map, where reddish areas indicate high uncertainty.

It was truly inspiring to connect with researchers at the intersection of AI, ML, and geoscience, learn from the keynotes of Prof.Jan Dirk Wegner and Dr.Jens Behley, and enjoy many insightful discussions.

A big thank you to Jan-Henrik Haunert for hosting the colloquium in Bonn, and to Prof.Monika Sester and Prof. Claus Brenner for their continuous support of my research at Institut für Kartographie und Geoinformatik (IKG).
