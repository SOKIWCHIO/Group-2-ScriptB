In the real world, guessing isn’t just wrong—it can be dangerous. 

In education, we reward confidence over caution. Students learn to guess on tests, to perform certainty, to fake fluency when unsure. But in high-stakes situations—clinical decisions, software safety, financial models—a confident wrong answer can cost far more than an honest “I don’t know.”

AI has inherited this problem. Large language models are trained on data from sources like StackExchange, Reddit, Wikipedia—places where confidence is king. The training objective is to predict the next token, not to evaluate whether the speaker actually knows what they’re talking about. The result? Fluent answers that often sound correct, but aren’t grounded in certainty. We’ve trained our models to bluff.

Fixing this would mean relabeling huge amounts of training data to reflect not just what was said, but how it was said: was the answer cautious? hedged? overconfident? That’s expensive. It requires expert annotators, not crowdworkers. But the result would be AI that behaves less like a trivia bot and more like a careful expert.

It’s a hard problem. But I think it’s the next step toward building models we can actually trust—not just for answers, but for judgment.

If you're thinking about epistemic humility in AI, let’s connect.

Great post. If we were to extend the problem of uncertainty further, it would be great to think about uncertainty that comes simply from randomness in the world. Why is the model unsure? Is the world uncertain or is the model ignorant? An aleatoric uncertainty if you will.
