🚀 Excited to share our latest dataset: "Household-level #occupancy profiles generated using Bayesian Neural Networks (#BNNs) for occupancy #prediction under #uncertainty in residential buildings."

This dataset is a comprehensive resource for researchers and professionals, containing time-series data of #occupancy #availability and #metabolic #rates for house-type and apartment-type dwellings, recorded at 10-minute intervals. We developed this dataset using BNN based on the Time Use Survey (TUS) data to enhance accuracy in predicting occupancy patterns and understanding energy consumption in residential settings.

🏠 Dataset Highlights:
1500 CSV Files: 1000 files for house-type and 500 files for apartment-type dwellings.
Detailed Records: Time-series data captured every 10 minutes.
Research Applications: Ideal for building energy modelling, multi-scale energy analysis, and occupancy prediction.

🌍 Impact and Usefulness:
Energy Efficiency: Helps optimise energy use in residential buildings by accurately predicting occupancy patterns.
Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ): Supports research on improving air quality, thermal comfort, and overall living conditions.
Smart Homes: Enables the development of intelligent systems that adapt to residents' behaviour for better comfort and energy savings.
