Overcoming Multi-step Complexity in Multimodal Theory-of-Mind Reasoning: A Scalable Bayesian Planner
📄 Paper: arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01301
🖥️ Code: https://lnkd.in/dsAScQQM
- New work on scalable Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning!
- We propose a Bayesian ToM planner that decomposes social reasoning into stepwise updates, enabling small language models (7B) to specialize in ToM estimation and transfer their reasoning to larger models (405B).
- This weak-to-strong control improves generalization across complex, multimodal environments. It achieves +4.6% over SOTA on ToM benchmarks, even in unseen settings. Let’s bring human-like mental state modeling to the next level.

StimuVAR: Spatiotemporal Stimuli-aware Video Affective Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models
📄 Paper: arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00304
🖥️ Code: https://lnkd.in/dvqNGvSe (code will be released soon.)
- Introducing the first MLLM-based framework for Video Affective Reasoning (VAR) — predicting how videos make people feel, not just what they depict!
- We enhance emotional understanding with (1) frame-level + token-level stimuli-aware mechanisms, (2) new VAR instruction data for affective training, and (3) comprehensive evaluation with rich emotional metrics.
- The proposed method boosts MLLMs’ ability to explain emotional reactions — a step toward socially intelligent AI.
