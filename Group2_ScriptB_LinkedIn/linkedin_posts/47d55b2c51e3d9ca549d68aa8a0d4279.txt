🚀 Going from Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) to Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials (BLIPs)!

MLIPs are transforming chemistry simulations, but they often break down when data is scarce or when facing out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, they rarely tell us how confident they are in their predictions!

In our latest work, we introduce BLIPs, which add a Bayesian layer around of MLIPs to deliver:

✅ More reliable predictions in challenging regimes (data-scarce or out-of-distribution)
✅ Trustworthy, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
✅ A plug-and-play boost to predictive accuracy with minimal overhead

💡 In our experiments, BLIPs outperform Deep Ensembles (and other baselines) for MLIPs, both in accuracy (forces & energies) and in uncertainty estimation. And the best part: you only need one BLIP model, not an ensemble!
Even more, fine-tuning existing Universal Interatomic Potentials with BLIP yields substantial gains compared to standard or ensemble fine-tuning.

This was an amazing collaboration with Pim de Haan and Max Welling from CuspAI!

Extra: BLIPs are not limited to MLIP; they can be applied to any Message Passing Neural Network. We look forward to seeing more applications of this!
