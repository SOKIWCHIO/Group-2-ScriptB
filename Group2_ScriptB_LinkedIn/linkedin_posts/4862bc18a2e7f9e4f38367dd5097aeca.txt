Our Software Update paper highlighting the Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) module of UQpy is now available. Check out the new features for Bayesian neural networks and neural operators. The SciML module integrates seamlessly with PyTorch and includes several new features that are plug-and-play for UQ in machine learning. 

Thanks to everyone who contributed, especially Connor Krill and Ponkrshnan Thiagarajan. And, as always, UQpy would not be what it is without the sustained efforts of Dimitris Giovanis and Dimitris Tsapetis.

🔬 New Preprint Out! 🚀

I'm excited to share that our latest work is now on arXiv:

📄 Bayesian Neural Networks versus deep ensembles for uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials

 🔗 https://lnkd.in/d62D-5Gj 

In this study, we explore how to quantify uncertainty in deep learning-based interatomic potentials — a critical step toward making machine learning models more reliable and deployable in materials simulations.

We benchmark two major approaches:
-Deep Ensembles (practical, scalable)
-Variational Bayesian Neural Networks (principled, probabilistic)

We introduce bayesian-aenet, an open-source framework built on aenet-PyTorch, Pyro, and TyXe, designed for rigorous UQ benchmarking on ML
