Assistant Professor of ML @ MBZUAI

1 年  已编辑

I’m starting a new position as Assistant Professor of Machine Learning in MBZUAI. 

Interested in working with me on topics related to interactive learning, probabilistic modelling (GFlowNets and friends), or LLM reasoning? Contact me! I'm looking to expand my group with PhD and master's students, a postdoc, and research assistants/interns.
EDIT: No internship/postdoc position available anymore for 2025.
EDIT2: Fill out this form to apply: https://lnkd.in/erd_y8y2. There is no need to send me an email once you do that.
