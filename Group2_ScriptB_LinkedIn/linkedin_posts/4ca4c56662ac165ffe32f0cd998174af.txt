Very “pungent” (can’t help it too easy 🤣) but oh-so accurate. Back at Snowflake, we used to say you couldn't have an AI strategy without a data strategy. An LLM is essentially a probabilistic model of very large, unstructured data. If your AI learn from bad information, it'll repeat bad information.

Stakes are just that much higher with Agents; bad conversation becomes bad actions.

It’s all about data….

AI is cool but still one of the biggest challenges for customers today it’s on the data part. And this is super important because it’s something you just cannot skip.

You can create a cool chatbot, virtual assistant or even re use some ML models to cluster your customers, but if the quality of your data “sucks”, the output you’ll get will suck too. Regardless if it’s ML, AI, GenAI or Agents. The output will still be the same 💩 💩💩

Kudos to Dr. Christian Krug for his previous post on this topic 🙌

It's fascinating how the stakes rise with Agents, pushing us to scrutinize data quality even more rigorously. The ethical implications of LLMs learning from biased information are a constant concern for researchers like myself. How do you envision mitigating these risks in practical applications?
