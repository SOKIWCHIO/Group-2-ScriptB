📢 Wrapping up a fantastic day at the #ICCV2023 Workshop on Uncertainty Quantification for Computer Vision in Paris!

Firstly, a huge thanks you to all our esteemed invited speakers:
🎙 Eric Nalisnick, University of Amsterdam
🎙 Fatma Güney, University of Koc
🎙 Janis Postels, ETH Zurich
🎙 Dan Hendrycks, University of California, Berkeley
🎙 Zeynep Akata, University of Tuebingen

The insights on the different facets of uncertainty, ranging from anomaly detection to the interplay of assumptions in self-driving technologies, have truly enriched the discourse. We were assigned the largest hall at the convention centre, which tells about interest in uncertainty quantification in the computer vision community.

Thanks also to all the contributors for their innovative research and thought-provoking presentations. Special mentions to the contributed talks: 

🔹 "Probabilistic MIMO U-Net: Efficient and Accurate Uncertainty Estimation for Pixel-wise Regression"
🔹 "Far Away in the Deep Space: Dense Nearest-Neighbor-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection"
🔹 "Calibrated Out-of-Distribution Detection with a Generic Representation"
🔹 "Gaussian Latent Representations for Uncertainty Estimation using Mahalanobis Distance in Deep Classifiers"
🔹 "Probabilistic MIMO U-Net: Efficient and Accurate Uncertainty Estimation for Pixel-wise Regression"

The MUAD Uncertainty Estimation for Semantic Segmentation Challenge was another highlight!

Deep appreciation to fellow organizers for making this a seamless experience. This workshop has truly underscored the importance of integrating uncertainty quantification in vision systems, promoting safer and more reliable applications.

Thanks to everyone who joined us today at the Paris Convention Center. Looking forward to seeing you all in future events. Let's continu
