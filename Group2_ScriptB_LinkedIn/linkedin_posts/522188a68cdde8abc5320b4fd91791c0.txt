🔍 Disentangling Uncertainties in System Dynamics 🔍

Recent advancements in uncertainty estimation have led to the development of the Compressed Data Representation Model (CDRM), which effectively distinguishes between aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) and epistemic uncertainty (data scarcity) within learned regressive system dynamics models. 

This innovative framework leverages a neural network to encode data distributions, facilitating direct sampling from output distributions without being limited to Gaussian priors. 

Key highlights of CDRM include:

- Novel Inference Procedure: Utilizes Langevin dynamics sampling for enhanced prediction capabilities.
  
- Theoretical Advantages: Demonstrates improved memory and computational efficiency compared to traditional bin-based compression methods.

- Empirical Success: Achieves Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (AUROCs) of 0.8876 for aleatoric and 0.9981 for epistemic uncertainties, showcasing its superior performance on complex datasets with multimodal output distributions.

This research significantly contributes to risk-aware control, reinforcement learning, efficient exploration, and robust policy transfer in dynamic systems.
