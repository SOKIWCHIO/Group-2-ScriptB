Optimization theory didn’t click for me until embarrassingly late. And if I were to be fair, it still isn’t my strong suit.

As a statistician, I was trained to think in terms of estimators, likelihoods, variance, and bias. Optimization was always there—but in the background. An afterthought. Something the algorithm did while I focused on “the real math.”

But the more I worked in applied ML, the more I realized:

➡️ Optimization isn’t just the tool we use to train models. It is the model.
	•	MLE? Solve an optimization problem.
	•	Ridge/Lasso? Add constraints and penalties—optimize again.
	•	Even Bayesian inference (if you’re doing MAP)? Still optimization.

And when something breaks—poor convergence, weird results, unstable metrics—it’s almost always the optimization pipeline silently screaming.

These days, I find myself thinking more about geometry—curvature, convexity, saddle points—than I ever expected to. Because that’s where the story really is.

And maybe that’s the quiet insight optimization teaches us:

Sometimes, the model is fine. It’s the landscape we built around it that needs reshaping.

If you’re a statistician moving into ML—or an ML engineer who skipped the theory—I’d strongly recommend circling back to optimization. You’ll start seeing your models differently.

Hey, I am an aspiring mathematician who is deeply interested in Mathematical Optimization looking at this post! This is all really true and really interesting! I hope that you can accept my follow request so that we can continue chatting.

Best,
Sid

What are some good reading materials as a starting point? I took an optimization course years ago, but forgot a lot of things. It was mathematical optimization course, so I think the material may b
