For the past five years as a data scientist, I've worked relentlessly to improve the accuracy and reliability of my machine-learning models. Even though I’ve optimized error metrics and used multiple explainable AI (#XAI) methods to make my ML models more reliable and make non-technical people understand the model predictions, I used to often wonder: How can I truly guarantee that my model predictions are accurate with a certain degree of confidence?

While probability calibration methods offered some help by giving probabilities instead of class scores. But I always wanted more certainty about prediction accuracy. That’s when I discovered conformal prediction in 2024. It’s an amazing technique that provides calibrated probability ranges and confidence levels instead of point predictions, ensuring that predictions are backed by a statistical guarantee.

Conformal prediction could really change how I approach predictive modelling tasks by giving me reliable and calibrated prediction intervals. This course is a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into these methods and integrate them with my current models, making them even better.

Winning a spot in this course would not only improve my skills but also help me deliver more reliable insights in my work. I’m excited to explore these techniques and apply them to my projects for better decision-making.

Thank you for considering my entry. I’m looking forward to the chance to learn conformal
