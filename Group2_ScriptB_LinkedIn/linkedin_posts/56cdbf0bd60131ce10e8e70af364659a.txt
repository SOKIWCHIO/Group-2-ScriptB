Just ordered my physical copy (because I'm addicted to books) but I'm already going to recommend this for anyone interested in #sportsanalytics research with player-tracking and pose data! Rafael's work was the foundation for multiple #CMSAC papers https://lnkd.in/gfq9UP-K

📚 Book Announcement! 😊 ⁣
⁣
I'm excited to share my new book: ⁣
𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐞𝐲𝐨𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: 𝐔𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐲 𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.⁣
⁣
Targeted at practitioners and researchers with a good mathematical background, this book provides tools to make predictions more reliable by addressing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. It explores essential topics such as conditional density estimation, Gaussian processes, BART, conformal prediction, and calibration techniques. ⁣
⁣
Featuring real-world applications from cosmology to disease surveillance, it equips readers to move beyond point predictions in artificial intelligence and better communicate uncertainty. ⁣
⁣
You'll find hands-on examples and code in an accompanying GitHub repo. ⁣
⁣
📥 Download it for free or get a printed copy at: ⁣
👉 rafaelizbicki.com/UQ4ML (for access outside Brazil) ⁣
👉 rafaelizbicki.com/UQ4MLpt (for Brazil) ⁣
⁣
Hope you find it useful!
