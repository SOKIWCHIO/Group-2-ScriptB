Let's Learn Generative AI Together!

Thank you to everyone who participated in the recent poll about your interest in my posts' content. The results are in, and a whopping 70% of you would like to read more about Generative AI topics! Your enthusiasm and engagement inspire me to dive deeper into this fascinating field.

To kickstart our journey into Generative AI, I've created a roadmap that outlines how we'll explore various aspects of this innovative technology. Here's what you can expect:

1. Introduction to Generative AI:
  - Overview of Generative AI and its significance.
  - Key concepts: generative models, latent space, sampling, and reconstruction.

2. Generative Models:
  - Probabilistic models: Gaussian mixture models, variational autoencoders (VAEs).
  - Neural network-based models: Autoencoders, generative adversarial networks (GANs).

3. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):
  - Architecture and components of GANs.
  - Training GANs: adversarial loss, generator, discriminator.
  - Applications: image generation, style transfer, data augmentation.

4. Autoencoders:
  - Encoder-decoder architecture.
  - Variants: denoising autoencoders, variational autoencoders (VAEs).
  - Applications: image reconstruction, anomaly detection.

5. Language Models and Text Generation:
  - Sequence modeling: recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
  - Transformers and attention mechanisms.
  - Text generation techniques: word-based models, character-based models.
  - Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.

6. Image Generation and Style Transfer:
  - Conditional GANs (cGANs) for controlled image generation.
  - StyleGAN and its applications in photorealistic image synthesis.
  - Neural style transfer:
