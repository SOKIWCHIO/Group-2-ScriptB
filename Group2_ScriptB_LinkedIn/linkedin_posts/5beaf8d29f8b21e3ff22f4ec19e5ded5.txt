🚀 Excited to share our new paper in Science Advances! - "AI-powered automated model construction for patient-specific CFD of aortic flows"

Building vascular models from medical images for patient-specific CFD simulations is typically manual, slow, and inconsistent. Our work presents an end-to-end deep learning solution that generates simulation-ready models directly from images, reducing human effort while improving reproducibility. What's new:

⭐ LoGB-Net: A Bayesian segmentation network that captures both the main aorta and small branches with state-of-the-art accuracy.
⭐  GNN-LDDMM: A graph neural network for mesh deformation, aligning models seamlessly to image gradients and improving geometric fidelity for CFD.
⭐ Uncertainty quantification: We explicitly model segmentation uncertainty and demonstrate how it propagates to CFD outputs (pressure, wall shear stress).

I’m thrilled to share that our latest paper has just been published in Science Advances:
“AI-powered automated model construction for patient-specific CFD of aortic flows.”
This work is a collaboration between me and Delin An, Prof. Chaoli Wang, Prof. Jian-Xun Wang. from University of Notre Dame and Cornell University. 

Our model is designed to accelerate traditional manual aorta segmentation with AI, introducing several uniquely important features:
🚀 Bayesian segmentation with UQ: We empl
