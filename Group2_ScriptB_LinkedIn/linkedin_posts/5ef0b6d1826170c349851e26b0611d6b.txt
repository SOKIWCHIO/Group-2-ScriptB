PyData Paris 2024 45-minute Keynote by Olivier Grisel:
🟠 Handling predictive uncertainty in machine learning 

Machine Learning practitioners build predictive models from "noisy" data resulting in uncertain predictions. But what does "noise" mean in a machine learning context?

Very interesting presentation! Nice how you show that the well tuned pipeline containing a LogisticRegression model results in well calibrated model predictions. I actually don't think this would work with all classification algorithms. For example, a RandomForestClassifier will almost never result in well calibrated probabilities, even after applying thourough hyperparameter tuning. The algorithm is unlikely to produce probabilities close to 0 and 1, because for these scores all trees in the ensemble need to predict 0 or 1 in order for the mean to be 0 or 1.

BTW, we will explore those ideas and related code in more details at the Masterclass event organized :probabl.'s Paris offices on December, 11:

I attended this one. I believe NannyML people might be interested by the topic.
