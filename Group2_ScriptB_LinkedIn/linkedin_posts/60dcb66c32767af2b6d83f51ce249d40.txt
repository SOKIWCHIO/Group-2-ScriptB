🚀Microblocking + Machine Learning: Block-by-Block Uncertainty

A technique published in March 2025 is fundamentally transforming the way we estimate mineral resources. Microblocking powered by machine learning is not just another tool-it represents a paradigm shift that integrates data science with geology. 

🔹What makes microblocking revolutionary?
Traditionally, resource estimation has relied on geostatistical methods such as kriging. 

Microblocking reframes the challenge as a machine learning problem, introducing capabilities that were previously unimaginable: 
 - Automated Deployment: Self-updating models;
- Remote Monitoring: Real-time operation;
- Big Data Ready: Handles massive volumes of geodata;
- Epistemic Uncertainty: Quantifies what we genuinely do not know.
 
 🔹The breakthrough - Uncertainty Propagation: 
- The core innovation lies in the way this method propagates epistemic uncertainty-the uncertainty that exists simply because we lack sufficient data. In mining, drill holes reveal less than 0.001% of a deposit’s total volume. 

🔹How it works in practice:
- Ensemble Sub-Sampling: Multiple ML models trained on different data subsets;
 
 - Out-of-Sample Testing: Rigorous validation grounded in ML principles;

 - Block-Specific Uncertainty: Confidence levels estimated for each individual block;
 
- Intelligent Sequencing: Prioritizes sampling in areas of both high uncertainty and high economic potential 
 
🔹Advantages over traditional methods:
✅ More Specific: Uncertainties calculated block by block, not only at the global scale; 
✅ More Comprehensive: Broader scope than kriging variance; 
✅ Real-Time: Continuous updates with new data ;
✅ Cost-Effective: Automatically optimizes drilling campaigns.

🔹Real-world application:
