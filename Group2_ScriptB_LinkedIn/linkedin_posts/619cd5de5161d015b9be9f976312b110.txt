I'm thrilled to announce that my book has completed the editing process and is now ready for publication! This has been an incredible journey, and I'm excited to share it with you all. This book dives into key concepts across the modeling landscape from traditional statistics to deep learning approaches, and also covers data processing, uncertainty estimation, interpretation and more. I hope it serves as a valuable resource for practitioners and learners alike.

📖 Print Release Date: August 15, 2025

A huge thank you to the team at CRC Press for their assistance, and to Malcolm Barrett, Chelsea Parlett, and Demetri Pananos Ph.D for their thoughtful reviews that helped make this book even better!
