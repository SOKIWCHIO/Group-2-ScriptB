Data-driven decision-making is not new, although the market might have felt that way in the past 10 years. Prediction uncertainty is neither a new concept, though new techniques rise at a similar pace as new modeling techniques arise. My colleague Robbert van Kortenhof did a great writeup on different kinds of uncertainty and how to deal with them in conformal predictions.

In data science, uncertainty is not a limitation—it’s a path to more reliable and fair predictions. In my latest blog post for BigData Republic, I dive into how conformal prediction helps quantify this uncertainty to improve decision-making. Find the link in the comments. 

In the blog, we will cover:
🧠 Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty, the distinction between knowledge gaps and inherent randomness, and why both are key for robust models

📊 Better decision making, how incorporating uncertainty leads to more fair and transparent outcomes in applications such as credit scoring and  investment

📐 Conformal Prediction, a model-agnostic framework that generates statistically valid prediction intervals or sets of classes

🐍 Going through a step-by-step example of conformal prediction in Python using libraries like crepes
