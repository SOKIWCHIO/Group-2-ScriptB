One of the best events of my life was to cross path with my friend Frédéric Branchaud-Charron in 2018. 4 years later, our paths have now diverged quite extensively. From Uncertainty estimation and active learning days, I went all the way to dipping my toes in Graph Learning and then jumping into Image and video Generation state. Such an amazing roller coaster and same for my friend. However, what we started 4 years ago still goes strong. I am so proud that "Baal" has now more than 700 stars on GitHub and daily new visitors. Our slack community is getting more active and I see more and more students and startups actually using our tool. I think an experience like this where you can support your community is very unique and is constantly giving me a sense of satisfaction which is independent from where I am in life. All thanks to one day choosing to say hi to each other <3 
Visit our tool if active learning is something which can make your life easier and reduce some costs in your startup or if you are a student and want to benchmark your method against the most popular methods. We are trying to keep the tool uptodate so please open issues and let us know what you want. 

Last thing, the tool is OpenSourced because we believe in the community. Don't hesitate to open a Pull request, this is the best way to make an impact.
