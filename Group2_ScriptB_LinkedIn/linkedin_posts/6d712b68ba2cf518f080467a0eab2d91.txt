🚀🚀 Pre-print alert 🚀🚀

❓Uncertainty quantification is undoubtedly one of the hottest topics in Geophysics nowadays. But how do we ensure that the uncertainty that we estimate is really meaningful and it is not just the by-product of the many hyper-parameters that enter an inversion process?

🛠 My Phd student Miguel Angel Corrales (during his internship in TotalEnergies) and our visiting student Sean Berti (from the University of Pisa) spent a considerable amount of time investigating the behavior of SVDG in the context of FWI… and the results that we obtained tell us that the SVGD’s hyper-parameters can significantly impact our final estimate of uncertainty, much more than what previously reported in the literature. 

💡 The good news is that we have been able to identify a number adjustments that can make this effect less severe alongside two strategies to obtain a more meaningful statistical analysis of the final particles.
