In computer vision and medical image analysis, Bayesian networks stand out as a powerful approach for integrating prior knowledge, modeling complex relationships, and handling uncertainty in data through a structured, probabilistic framework. 

This past week, I had the incredible opportunity, alongside Lakyiere Alice Bagyiereyele, to attend the Probabilistic AI School (ProbAI) held in Trondheim, Norway. It was truly a privilege to learn from world-class researchers and connect with brilliant minds from across the globe who are equally passionate about advancing AI through principled, probabilistic approaches. 

Throughout the week-long, immersive program, we explored a wide range of topics, ranging from how Probabilistic Programming Language enable flexible modeling and efficient inference, to using Variational Inference and Optimization as essential tools for approximating complex distributions. We also delved into Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as a foundational method for posterior sampling, and learned how to marry deep learning with uncertainty quantification through Bayesian Neural Networks.

The insights gained from this experience are invaluable, particularly as I continue to explore how probabilistic methods can enhance the reliability and interpretability of medical AI systems.

I'm grateful to the organizers, lecturers, and peers for such a transformative experience, and excited about the future of Bayesian deep learning in solving real-world healthcare problems.
