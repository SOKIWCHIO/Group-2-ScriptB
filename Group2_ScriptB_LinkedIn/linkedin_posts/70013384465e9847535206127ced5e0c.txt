Excited to share our latest publication in the Journal of Hydroinformatics!

Our team developed a hybrid machine learning and physics-based modeling framework to improve streamflow prediction in ungauged rivers, integrating uncertainty quantification to better inform risk-based decision-making. Applied to a river basin in Colorado, this approach reduced prediction error by approximately 40% compared to purely data driven models, while also providing credible uncertainty bounds essential for flood management and water resource planning.

This work is the result of a multi-year collaborative effort between Hottinger Bruel & Kjaer Solutions, the University of Michigan, the University of California San Diego, and ERDC-CHL, building on our previous research in hydrologic modeling and ML approaches.

Today, we are presenting our final #KCB sessions at the 52nd Congress of the International Association of Hydrogeologists. Lead Hydrogeologist Damian Lee will be discussing "Leveraging Down-Hole Geophysical Data for Hydrogeologic Characterization." 

Following this session, Senior Hydrogeologist Claire Kent will be presenting on "Embracing a Digital Hydrogeology Future: Practical Applications of Business Intelligence (BI) Software and Python for Efficient Analysis and Visualisation of Groundwater Monitoring Data co-authored by Hydrogeological Engineer Emily Mee.

Lastly, Hydrogeologist Kevin de Bruin will be showcasing his poster presentation "Navigating Hydrogeological Challenges on a Remote, Geothermally Active Tropical Island" today and tomorrow at the 52nd Congress of the International Association of
