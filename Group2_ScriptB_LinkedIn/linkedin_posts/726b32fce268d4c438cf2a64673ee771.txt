New SFI Visual Intelligence paper featured in EurekAlert!: AI matches human experts in classifying microscopic organisms 🤖 🐚

A recent study shows how deep learning can achieve human-level performance in estimating uncertainty when classifying foraminifera—marine organisms typically found in marine environments

The study is authored by by PhD Candidate Iver Martinsen and colleagues at Visual Intelligence, UiT- The Arctic University of Norway, Nofima and Norwegian Centre for E-health Research

Past research has attempted to automate these classification tasks—a usually laborious and time-consuming manual process—with deep learning methods. Though several studies show significant promise, few have focused on the uncertainty of the methods’ classifications

“Uncertainty estimation is crucial to avoid misclassifications that could overlook rare and ecologically significant species. It is important to develop deep learning methods which accurately calculate how uncertain their predictions are”, says Martinsen
