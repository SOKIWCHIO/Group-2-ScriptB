Idk how many times reviewers have complained that we should use something other than a simple linear model (even though the linear model works great). In physics you’re taught to use the simplest model that works…

MIT News writes today about our new paper: We show that a simple linear model can outperform a large-scale AI foundation model, in particular for creating fast approximations to climate models. In the paper we offer an explanation with lessons on benchmarking, bias-variance tradeoff, and natural climate variability.

Yup, this is a genuine challenge.   Do students learn enough about the perils of over-fitting in their classes?  Do they learn about the perils of high condition number?

Always start ML project with this simple models as baselines. Sometimes, you can save a lot of time and money proving that these deep and complicated architectures aren't worth it!
