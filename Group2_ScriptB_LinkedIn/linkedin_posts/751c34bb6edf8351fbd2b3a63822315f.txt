✨ I'm pleased to share that our paper, "𝐈𝐓³: 𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭-𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠", has been accepted to [ICML] Int'l Conference on Machine Learning 2025 in Vancouver ✨

Thanks to my co-authors Assaf Shocher, Doruk Oner, PhD, GAL CHECHIK, Alexei Efros, and Pascal Fua for a great collaboration — a joint effort between EPFL, NVIDIA, University of California, Berkeley, and Bilkent University.

𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭-𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 (𝐓𝐓𝐓) methods offer a promising way to adapt models during inference, but most rely on domain-specific auxiliary tasks, are difficult to generalize, or require substantial tuning. In this work, we take a different approach.

We introduce 𝐈𝐓³, a simple and task-agnostic method that enforces 𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞—making predictions stable under repeated applications. This allows the model to adapt to out-of-distribution inputs during inference, using only the current test instance, with no need for auxiliary losses or extra data.

IT³ achieves 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘦-𝘰𝘧-𝘵𝘩𝘦-𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 under distribution shift across a diverse set of domains: from ImageNet classification and road segmentation, to age prediction, tabular regression, and aerodynamic simulations with GNNs.

𝐖𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐫𝐲 𝐢𝐭 𝐨𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬? We provide a ready-to-use implementation in torch-ttt (https://lnkd.in/eWhqxBRH), and you can run it in just a few lines of code.
