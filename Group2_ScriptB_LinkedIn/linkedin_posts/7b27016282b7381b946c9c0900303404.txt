🌞👉𝓡𝓾𝓵𝓮-𝓑𝓪𝓼𝓮𝓭 𝓢𝔂𝓼𝓽𝓮𝓶𝓼: Definition: Rule-based systems utilize a set of predefined rules to make decisions or perform tasks. These rules are typically based on expert knowledge or predefined logical statements.
Rule Representation: Rules are typically expressed in the form of "if-then" statements. For example, "if condition A is met, then perform action B."
Decision Making: Rule-based systems follow a deterministic approach, where decisions are made based on the rules & the current state of the system.
Transparency: Rule-based systems provide high transparency and interpretability since the decision-making process is explicitly defined by the rules.
Scalability: Adding new rules to a rule-based system can become complex & time-consuming, especially when dealing with large rule sets.
Handling Uncertainty: Rule-based systems struggle to handle uncertainty and incomplete information effectively. 
🌞👉𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬: Definition: Probabilistic models utilize statistical inference & probability theory to make decisions or predictions based on available data.
Model Representation: Probabilistic models represent uncertainties & relationships using probability distributions and mathematical functions.
Decision Making: Probabilistic models consider probabilities and make decisions based on the likelihood of different outcomes.
Transparency: Probabilistic models can be less transparent compared to rule-based systems because the decision-making process is based on complex mathematical calculations and statistical methods.
Scalability: Probabilistic models are flexible & scalable.
Handling Uncertainty: Probabilistic models naturally handle uncertainty by assigning probabilities to different outcomes & can
