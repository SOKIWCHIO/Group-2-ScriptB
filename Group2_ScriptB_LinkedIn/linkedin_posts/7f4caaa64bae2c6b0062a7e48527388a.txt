PhD: DONE! 🎉 🎓🔥

Last month, I successfully defended my PhD and officially became Dr. Durasov, or as my diploma formally states, "𝘋𝘰𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘶𝘳 è𝘴 𝘚𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘴 𝘐𝘯𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘲𝘶𝘦𝘴 𝘦𝘵 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴".

Huge thanks to EPFL and EPFL School of Computer and Communication Sciences, my advisor Pascal Fua, my committee, collaborators, friends, and family who supported me throughout this journey — as well as the entire CVLab team, who made the past years both intellectually stimulating and enjoyable.

My thesis focused on uncertainty estimation for deep neural networks, particularly in safety-critical applications such as computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving. I investigated how to design models that can adapt to the unknown, handle out-of-distribution data, and provide reliable predictions in complex and dynamic environments. As autonomous models become increasingly prevalent, this topic has become crucial for ensuring reliable decision-making in today's world.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to have pursued my passion for research and learning at EPFL, and I'm looking forward to the new challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Thanks to everyone who has been a part of my PhD journey!
