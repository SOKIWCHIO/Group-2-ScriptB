Day 1 of the DLI Indaba included a series of rich and insightful sessions. I attended three key discussions:

Session 1: Globalizing Algorithmic Fairness and Why It Matters - Hosted by Awa Dieng Google DeepMind

Awa highlighted the importance of placing AI fairness in the context of Africa and considering its unique colonial history. The session discussed major challenges, including infrastructure limitations and socio-economic disparities.

Key recommendations included:
- Tailoring fairness criteria to the local context
- Awareness of historical biases towards western technology
- Exercising caution with pre-trained models

Key takeaways were:
- Emphasizing the collection of representative data
- Clearly defining fairness outcomes
- Developing algorithms with a thorough understanding of African contexts
- Involving local communities in the process
- Addressing deep-rooted structural and social challenges impacting AI fairness

Session 2: Probabilistic Thinking and Programming  Hosted by Kira Düsterwald & James Allingham

This session provided a comprehensive overview of probabilistic distributions, which are powerful tools for Machine Learning using Jax functions. It laid a solid foundation for reasoning about probabilistic models and events, covering probability distributions, random variables, and Bayesian reasoning.

Session 3: Limitations of Large Language Models Hosted by Flora Tasse NVIDIA
This session delved into the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduced the augmentation of Foundation LLMs with RAG. It discussed the benefits and limitations of this approach and included a basic implementation of RAG to LLM.
