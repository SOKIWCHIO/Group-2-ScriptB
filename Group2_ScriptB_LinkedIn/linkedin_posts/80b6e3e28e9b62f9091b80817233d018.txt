Can AI models help predict #hurricane season activity months in advance? Our latest research (https://lnkd.in/eGUPNZrz) suggests YES!

Collaborating with Megha Rao (Illinois/GS1), Janni Yuval (Google Research), and Ming Zhao (NOAA/GFDL), we used NeuralGCM, a hybrid AI-physics model, to make seasonal predictions (July-Nov) with simplified boundary forcings.

Key results:
- NeuralGCM successfully predicted year-to-year variations in tropical cyclone activity, especially for the Atlantic and East Pacific basins.
- The skill achieved is comparable to some traditional, computationally intensive climate models.
- This shows promise for using AI to build faster, more affordable, seamless forecasting systems.

I'm excited about how well NeuralGCM can simulate TC activity (see plot below) and make subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions. It is remarkable for a brand-new model with a novel architecture.

This work provides a baseline for model development and other research endeavors. There obviously is more to do. Looking forward to great progress in the coming months!
