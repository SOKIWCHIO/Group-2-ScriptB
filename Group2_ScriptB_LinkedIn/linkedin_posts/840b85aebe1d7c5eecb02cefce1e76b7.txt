How I would learn Data Science in 2025 👇

(Plus resources to learn each skill)


𝘏𝘪 😊 𝘮𝘺 𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘪𝘴 𝘋𝘢𝘸𝘯. 𝘐’𝘷𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘢 𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘢 𝘚𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘵 𝘢𝘵 𝘔𝘦𝘵𝘢, 𝘗𝘢𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘶𝘱𝘴. 𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘐 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 20+ 𝘤𝘭𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘴 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘰 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘳 𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘢 𝘫𝘰𝘣𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘵 𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳.


But if I had to learn Data Science from scratch...

THIS is the exact order of what I'll learn:


1️⃣ 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗦𝗤𝗟

SQL is a must-have skill for every data professional.

It is the primary way you get data OUT of a database.

It’s also a very easy coding language to start with.


Use Interview Master to learn and practice SQL:
→ Learn SQL: https://lnkd.in/gqwqD_9p
→ Practice SQL: https://lnkd.in/gAgSHW8Z


2️⃣ 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲 & 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲

Simply put, how to use Data to solve real problems

I would start building this “soft” skill early because 
(1) it takes time to really learn this, and 
(2) as you’re learning Stats + Python, you already have context on how these are used in the real world.

This book, Cracking the PM Career, was v helpful for me:

3️⃣ 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀

How much Stats do you need for Data Science? Just the foundations, but you need to know it really really well.

→ Descriptive statistics
→ Common distributions
→ Probability and Bayes’ Theorem
→ Basic Machine Learning models
→ Experimentation concepts
→ A/B experiment design

Check out Stanford’s Introduction to Statistics course. 


4️⃣ 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻

Python is the #1 skill for Data Scientists in 2025.

But it's 4th on this list because it builds on skills 1-3.

I learned Python on my own using 
→ DataCamp’s Python track: https://lnkd.in/gcjW6zpb
→ Building my own projects: https://lnkd.in/gK69GwGv

If I were learning data science from scratch in 2025, this is exactly what I would do. Hi, my name is Don. I've worked at Amazon and Meta, and
