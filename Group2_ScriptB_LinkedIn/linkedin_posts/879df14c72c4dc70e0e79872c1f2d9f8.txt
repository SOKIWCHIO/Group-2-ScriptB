Attended FDD in the age of AI and Big Data at the ICAEW today. Sharing a few thoughts here on:

So where are we with GenAI?
Speakers talked a bit of the progression from foundational uses of GenAI (search, summarise, create)
to narrow uses of GenAI (automation through agents and workflows)
to autonomous uses of GenAI (using agents to deliver fully autonomous).

I also see this same trend - even in my personal use of GenAI, "Google, help me build a meal plan for 2 adults and 2 kids for a week." "OK, now convert that meal plan to a grocery list." 
Wouldn't it be great to be able to then "OK, now go online and order the groceries through the Morrisons chatbot, let's prefer to go with the value budget options where available".

As accountants and deal advisors how can we best prepare for greater adoption of GenAI?
In the main you'd be happy to know the guidelines are "use your common sense" and be careful with drawing inferences from the results of a probabilistic model.

My personal 2 cents is that the status of LLM's and GenAI in general as probabilistic models isn't as strongly emphasised as it should be. I also expect that in the next couple of years that standard T&Cs and the ways of working will have greater adoption of AI / GenAI. Perhaps we'll see "typical" disclaimers of "this document contains portions produced by in-house generative AI models and none of your confidential proprietary data has been to used to train foundational models".

I think I spotted across the room 👋

Insightful reflections, Izam. Implications for auditing standards?
