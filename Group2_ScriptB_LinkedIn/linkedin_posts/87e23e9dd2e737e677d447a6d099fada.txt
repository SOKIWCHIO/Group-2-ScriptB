Join us next week (10/5, 14:00-17:30 CEST) for a Workshop on AI4EO for Natural Hazards Management, co-organized by @ESA Φ-lab, the National Observatory of Athens, Harokopio University of Athens and Max Planck Institute of Biogeochemistry. The workshop follows the conclusion of our SeasFire project (https://seasfire.hua.gr/), funded by European Space Agency - ESA, on earth system deep learning for seasonal fire forecasting.

The workshop will address different challenges in the topic of #ai for #disastermanagement. We will cover traditional DL approaches and dig into novel methods, such as #explainableai and #causality to establish trustworthy models and services, #graphneuralnetworks for capturing long range spatio-temporal dependencies and #probabilistic machine learning for uncertainty estimation.

We will present practical applications for all the three stages of the emergency management cycle: forecasting and preparedness, early warning, monitoring and impact assessment, and demonstrate the use of a variety of EO and non-EO data, including multi-spectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, interferometric SAR data along with meteorological, landscape and other geospatial data.
