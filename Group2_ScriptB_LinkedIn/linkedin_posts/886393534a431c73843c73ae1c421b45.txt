On Monday I was fortunate enough to celebrate the end of my 4 years at The University of Sheffield, as I finished with a First Class Honours in Computer Science. While this chapter of my life has now concluded, it has been one full of self-development and learning with many life-long friends and memories made.

During my final year, I had the pleasure of working alongside Haiping Lu and Lawrence Schobs for my dissertation project that explored epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation in medical landmark localisation tasks. It was a privilege to contribute to state-of-the-art research on the important topic of responsible artificial intelligence alongside some truly inspiration people.

The completion of my degree also signals the end of my near 4 years at Sheffield Solar. Over the years, I have been involved with a multitude of different projects ranging from the group's near-real-time and historical API for photovoltaic generation on the GB transmission network to contributing to a journal article and open dataset of solar installations across the country. A huge thank you goes out to my line manager Jamie Taylor for first trusting me with the Microgen project all those years ago.

Sheffield, it's been a blast! 🎓
