Our work in machine learning for disaster preparedness has been accepted for publication! We are interested in how machine learning can be applied to publicly available datasets to identify critical infrastructure and residential buildings to aid decision-making processes and subsequent recovery efforts.

Building occupancy type classification and uncertainty estimation using machine learning and open data

👉 https://bit.ly/3Qldbek

This research demonstrates the application of machine learning (ML) in predicting a building's occupancy type. By selecting relevant features from open datasets, we can effectively predict building occupancy type and assess various ML techniques. Residential buildings are more prevalent than commercial buildings, which are in turn more common than other building types. The study explore different methods to address this imbalance in classes and illustrates how Bayesian neural networks can aid in quantifying uncertainty. The findings offer insights into leveraging ML methods for building occupancy prediction nationwide in the United States.
