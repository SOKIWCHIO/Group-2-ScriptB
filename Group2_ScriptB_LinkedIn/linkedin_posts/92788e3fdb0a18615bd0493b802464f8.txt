Thrilled to announce that ChemLex has just published “Towards global reaction feasibility and robustness prediction with high throughput data and bayesian deep learning” in Nature Communications.

What we built
· Data flywheel for synthesis – We pair a high-throughput experimentation HTE platform with active learning enabled by Bayesian neural network BNN trained using NUTS sampling.
· Active exploration + uncertainty disentanglement – The model sequentially selects the most informative acid-amine condensation experiments, accelerating discovery while disentangles aleatoric vs. epistemic uncertainties.
· Industrial-grade insight – The model predicts reaction feasibility and quantifies reproducibility, laying a blueprint for next-gen, AI-driven automated organic chemistry lab workflows.

Open resources
· ~12 k real HTE acid-amine coupling reactions – the most extensive single HTE dataset at a volumetric scale for industrial delivery. DOI: https://lnkd.in/ghHQvifn
· Open-source code – End-to-end pipelines for Bayesian reactivity prediction and robustness estimation. A toolbox of many widely used uncertainty quantification UQ methods, including Bayesian neural networks NUTSandSVI, Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble learning, and deep kernel learning Gaussian processes.
