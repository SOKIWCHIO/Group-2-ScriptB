🚀 Just published a new preprint on arXiv (2411.05324)! 🚀

📄 SASWISE-UE: Segmentation and Synthesis with Interpretable Scalable Ensembles for Uncertainty Estimation

What’s the goal? 🌟 Making deep learning models in medical imaging more interpretable and reliable for clinical use. Here’s how we’re doing it:

Blockwise Dropout: Typical dropout introduces randomness for uncertainty but can weaken performance by disrupting the coordination of layers. In SASWISE-UE, we use blockwise dropout by grouping layers with similar functions into distinct blocks, then assembling the model from various candidate blocks. This design preserves model stability while enhancing uncertainty estimation—and even boosts performance!

For those passionate about AI in healthcare, here’s a framework designed to ensure models not only perform well but also communicate their confidence—making a real difference in patient care. 💡
