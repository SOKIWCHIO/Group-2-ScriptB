Co-Founder/CTO Flexify.ai - ex-LLama (LLama-3/LLama-4) / ex-Meta

1 个月

🚀 Co-Founder & CTO @ Flexify.ai

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve co-founded Flexify.AI, a GenAI-driven supply chain startup, alongside the founder Siva Devarakonda.

We’re starting our journey with TariffPro 👉 https://lnkd.in/dV_iAqdE
 — helping companies tackle the complex challenges of tariffs and navigate them with ease. If you know anyone struggling under the weight of tariffs, we’d love an introduction.

We’re proud to be part of the University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley SkyDeck  Batch 20 cohort, building from Berkeley, California. 🌉

The journey is just beginning, and we’re excited to make supply chains smarter with GenAI.
