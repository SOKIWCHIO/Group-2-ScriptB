Thrilled to share that our paper “𝘔𝘢𝘱𝘋𝘪𝘧𝘧𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯: 𝘎𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘋𝘪𝘧𝘧𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘝𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘻𝘦𝘥 𝘖𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘏𝘋 𝘔𝘢𝘱 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘜𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘺 𝘌𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘪𝘯 𝘈𝘶𝘵𝘰𝘯𝘰𝘮𝘰𝘶𝘴 𝘋𝘳𝘪𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨” has been accepted at IROS 2025! 🚀

Our work introduces 𝗠𝗮𝗽𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻, a generative model that captures real-world ambiguities by constructing multiple plausible HD maps from camera images in real time. The variance across these map samples serves as a reliable uncertainty estimate; we show it's 31% higher in occluded areas, enabling safer, uncertainty-aware navigation.

The image below shows this in action! A truck blocks the view, and our model generates diverse plausible predictions for the occluded road boundary. The variance map for 10 samples correctly highlights this region with high uncertainty, showing the model knows what it can't see.

A huge thank you to my co-authors Zihan Zhang, Zhipeng Mo, Md Zafar Anwar, Steffen Staab, and Sihao Ding for this fantastic collaboration.
