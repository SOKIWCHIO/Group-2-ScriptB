This morning, I sat down with an idea:
𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘐 𝘣𝘶𝘪𝘭𝘥 𝘢 𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘷𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘰 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘎𝘗𝘛 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘭𝘢𝘳𝘨𝘦 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘮𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘭𝘴 𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺 (𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘢𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘥𝘦𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘤 𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦𝘴) 𝘪𝘯 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 20 𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘴? 

Here’s what happened:
1️⃣ I created a script with ChatGPT-5 with my educational video GPT
2️⃣ I opened Synthesia and built an avatar-led narrative (Express 2 - hand motions included). I skipped the camera angles and stayed with one.
3️⃣ For B-roll? I asked ChatGPT to generate a Midjourney prompt from the original video script. The images came back in minutes from MJ.
4️⃣ Dropped those images into Google VEO 3, where ChatGPT also scripted camera directions and screen actions.
5️⃣ Exported the clips.
6️⃣ Compiled everything in TechSmith Camtasia and exported the MP4.

𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲: 20 Minutes
Output: a working rough cut training video.

If I wanted to refine it? Easy. 

I’d add diverse camera angles, swap in stronger B-roll, polish transitions, and even automate the workflow with Make.com or Zapier.

But here’s the real takeaway:
What used to take a team days can now be prototyped by one person before their second cup of coffee.

This isn’t just about speed. 

It’s about giving learning professionals the ability to test, iterate, and refine ideas faster than ever before.

It’s a new day. 𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘪𝘯𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘦.

Imagine asking the same question to ChatGPT twice and getting 2 slightly different answers each time. That's not a glitch, it's by design. Large language models don't think in black and white, they think in probabilities. By the end of this video, you'll understand how large language models like ChatGPT predict the next word not with certainty, but with probability.
