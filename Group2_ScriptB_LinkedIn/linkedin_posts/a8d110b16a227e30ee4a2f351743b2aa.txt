How do we turn a graph into a simplicial complex? 
This article walks through building one from an existing graph using the Hodge Laplacian, with examples in PyTorch Geometric and TopoNetX.

And the code is here : https://github.com/geometric-intelligence/TopoBench

There is no need to explicitly form the Hodge Laplacians if just computing eigenvectors or solving linear systems with a Krylov solver that supports an ARPACK-style matrix-free interface, as you can compute the matrix-vector products in sparse factored form by iteratively applying the boundary/coboundary operators and so avoid the potentially painful SpGEMM operations needed to form the Laplacians explicitly.

Patrick Nicolas we make graph lifting to various topological spaces more systematic in our recent package : https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06642 we define what lifting means in theory and explore practical liftings from graph to simplicial/cell and combinatorial complexes. Liftings were classified as static and learnable and all results on these liftings were reported as a part of our benchmark on many recent topological nueral networks. Code is also available and tested heavily, work lead by  Lev Telyatnikov and Theodore Papamarkou
