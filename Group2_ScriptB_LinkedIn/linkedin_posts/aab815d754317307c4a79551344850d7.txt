The AI Stack Engineer | AI Strategist and Educator | AI/ML Developer Advocate @ MongoDB

9 个月

One thing I value about the AI and Data community is that although a lot of attention has come into the space over the years, there are those we call real OGs who were active in space before Prompt Engineering became a dream job.

And one of them is Harpreet Sahota 🥑

There are many things Harpreet has achieved within the AI/Data space. Below are a few:
→ Podcast host with 100s of episodes
→ Developer Advocate
→ LinkedIn Instructor
→ Data Scientist
→ Statistician
→ and more.

And now... Harpreet is doing more to combine that Data and AI world with his comprehensive 6-week cohort-based course on Applied Generative AI for Data Professionals! 🚀 

If you're a data practitioner looking to level up your GenAI skills, this course offers:
🔹 Interactive live sessions covering everything from LLMs and VLMs to RAG 
🔹 Hands-on experience with tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex
🔹 Real-world projects and practical applications 
🔹 Direct access to Harpreet's expertise 
🔹 Lifetime access to course materials
🔹 A private community of peers

With this course, Harpeet has created a resource for data practitioners to learn about everything happening in AI in 2024 and effectively prepare for 2025.
