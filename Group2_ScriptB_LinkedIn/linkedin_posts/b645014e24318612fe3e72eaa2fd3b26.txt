7 Best ML Models to Model Uncertainty

(Description, Pros & Cons) 👇

🔥 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗠𝗟 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗲 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲: https://lnkd.in/emb4cFCS

🔵 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 
→ Creates reliable confidence intervals by analyzing historical prediction errors. 

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀: Works with any model architecture and mathematically guarantees coverage. 

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀: Can become computationally expensive as data volume grows.

🔵 𝗚𝗮𝘂𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀 (𝗚𝗣𝘀) 
→ Bayesian framework that quantifies uncertainty through learned covariance structures. 

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀: Delivers theoretically sound uncertainty estimates with strong calibration. 

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀: Struggles with computational efficiency on large-scale problems.

🔵 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 
→ Directly models prediction intervals by estimating conditional quantile functions. 

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀: Straightforward implementation with clear interpretability and no distributional assumptions. 

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀: Requires training separate models per quantile; limited to aleatoric uncertainty.

🔵 𝗕𝗮𝘆𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 
→ Maintains probability distributions over all model weights rather than point estimates. 

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀: Natural regularization against overfitting with principled Bayesian uncertainty. 

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀: Computationally intensive inference that's sensitive to prior specifications.

🔵 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗼𝘃 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗹𝗼 (𝗠𝗖𝗠𝗖) 
→ Generates samples from posterior distributions using probabilistic sampling chains. 

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀: Theoretically exact results with broad applicability across model types. 

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀: Extremely time-consuming, particularly for high-dimensional parameter spaces.

🔵 𝗡𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗙𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀 
→ Constructs flexible posterior approximations via sequences of invertible transformations. 

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀: Handles complex distributions efficiently with exact likelihood computation.

 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀: Architecture design is challenging; train
