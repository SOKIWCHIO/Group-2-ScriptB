What if a global weather ensemble could run in under a minute—and still beat the best physics and ML forecasters?

Google DeepMind’s new FGN model shows it’s possible.

Key take-aways we find strategic: 
1. FGN improves marginal CRPS vs. the previous SOTA GenCast on 99.9 % of variables/levels, with gains up to 18 %. 
2. Eight-times faster inference. A full 15-day, 6-hourly ensemble rolls out in ≈60 s on one TPU-v5p, thanks to a single forward pass instead of diffusion loops—despite the model being larger and higher-rate. 
3. Joint structure, not just pixels. FGN cuts pooled-field CRPS by ≈8 – 9 % and slashes cyclone-track position error by ~24 h relative to GenCast—evidence it learns spatial and cross-variable correlations, not mere pointwise stats.
4. Uncertainty modelled in the weights. Ensembling four independently-trained networks and injecting low-dimensional noise through every layer lets FGN capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty without costly Monte-Carlo inputs. 

For CSRCT, FGN shifts the policy focus from raw FLOP counts to training design: smarter noise-in-weights and ensemble tricks can outpace brute-force scaling. That opens space for governance levers around reward functions, calibration audits, and verifier access to ensemble telemetry—not just hardware quotas.

Hats off to Ferran Alet Puig, Ilan Price, Andrew El-Kadi, Dominic Masters, Alvaro Sanchez Gonzalez, Peter Battaglia & the DeepMind WeatherLab team.
