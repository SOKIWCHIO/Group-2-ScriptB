I’m excited to share that our new research paper titled 'Uncertainty-Aware Deep Neural Representations for Visual Analysis of Vector Field Data' has been accepted for presentation in the main track of IEEE Visualization Conference 2024, Florida, USA! The paper will be published in a special issue of the top visualization journal IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (IEEE TVCG). 

This work delves into uncertainty quantification and its visual interpretation for vector field data when compressive deep learning models are used to reconstruct vector datasets. We study different methods of uncertainty estimation techniques for deep neural networks and how such prediction (epistemic) uncertainty helps in better interpreting the vector field features such as streamlines, critical points, extracted from model predicted vector fields, making the results more explainable, reliable, and trustworthy.

Special thanks to my students Atul Kumar and Siddharth Garg for their dedication and hard work.
