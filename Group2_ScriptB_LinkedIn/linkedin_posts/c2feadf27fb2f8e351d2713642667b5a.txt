Large Language Models aren’t “general intelligence.” They’re probability engines.
Here’s what actually happens:
- Given a context, they predict the most likely next word.
- Within the neural network, clusters of neurons specialize — some activate on medical text, others on finance, others still in romantic advise.
- This gives the illusion of understanding, but in truth it’s pattern recognition, not reasoning.

Researchers are trying to push beyond this:
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground answers in external knowledge.
- Multi-agent systems where LLMs talk to each other to solve complex problems.
- Symbolic reasoning layers to add logic.
- Some AGI attempts combine LLMs with montecarlo simulation or reinforcement learning among other fancy techniques.

These are exciting directions. But the LLM itself is not “GI” — and if we confuse the two, we risk misleading policymakers and executives into overhyping (or overregulating) the wrong thing.

How do you explain to leaders what these systems can — and cannot — really do?

Yet another time that people seem surprised at what should have been obvious for the last three years already
