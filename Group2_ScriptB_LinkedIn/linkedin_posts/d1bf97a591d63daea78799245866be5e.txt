Understanding and managing uncertainty in AI models is increasingly important to ensure transparency, appropriate trust, and reliability. This track explores diverse approaches to integrating uncertainty quantification into explainable AI (XAI) frameworks, emphasizing how explanations can communicate both model confidence and prediction reliability. Topics of interest include methods for representing and interpreting aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, as well as techniques that use these insights to guide decision-making processes in high-stakes environments. Submissions addressing uncertainty-aware explanations in areas such as reject/defer options, time series, and human-centric systems are particularly welcome. The track also seeks novel evaluation metrics and domain-specific applications of uncertainty-aware explanations, with the goal of advancing actionable and interpretable AI systems.
