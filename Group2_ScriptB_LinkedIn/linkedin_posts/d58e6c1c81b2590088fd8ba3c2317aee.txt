Hybrid AI for Better HVAC System Modeling under Uncertainty

Pleased to share our another recent publication in Energy and Buildings:
"Hybrid AI chiller model using transfer learning: Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty"

This study presents a hybrid AI framework for chiller performance prediction, integrating synthetic specification-based data with real operational data through transfer learning.

Key contributions include:
- Combining physics-based consistency with data-driven adaptability
- Enhancing extrapolation reliability under unseen operating conditions
- Quantifying model uncertainty (aleatoric & epistemic) via Bayesian deep learning

Our results show that the proposed model achieves comparable accuracy with significantly reduced uncertainty, making it a practical solution for applications like model predictive control (MPC) and real-time operation under variable conditions.

Sincere thanks to Prof. Cheol-Soo Park and all co-authors (Jinhong Kim, Youngsub Kim, Seon-young Heo) for their great collaboration.
