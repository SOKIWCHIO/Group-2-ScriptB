Linear Algebra — one of the most powerful tools behind machine learning and AI.

Why Linear Algebra?
 🔹 It’s the language of vectors, matrices, and transformations.
 🔹 Powers core ML techniques like dimensionality reduction, optimization, and neural networks.
 🔹 Helps you "see" data not just as numbers, but as structures and relationships.

What excites me the most is realizing that behind every AI model lies pure math.

 Understanding the math isn’t just academic—it gives you the intuition to debug models, optimize performance, and truly innovate.

I would recommend  Linear Algebra offered by DeepLearning.AI taught by Mr.Luis Serrano 🍉 to anyone looking to get familiar with the main concepts.

Today, I explored two essential pillars of Machine Learning and Programming: Mathematical Foundations in ML and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
🔑 Key Takeaways:
📊 Mathematics in Machine Learning
Mathematics is the backbone of ML algorithms. Some key areas I learned today:
Linear Algebra – Vectors, matrices, and operations that power neural networks.
Calculus – Derivatives and gradients used in optimization (like Gradient Descent).
Probability & Statistics – Helps in predictions, uncertainty estimation, and model evaluation.
Linear Regression Formula – Understanding the role of slope (m) and intercept (c) in prediction equations.
💡 These concepts explain why models behave the way they do, no
