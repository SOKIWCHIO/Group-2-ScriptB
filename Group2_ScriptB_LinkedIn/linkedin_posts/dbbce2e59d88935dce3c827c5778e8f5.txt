🚀 Exciting News: bnns is now officially on CRAN! 🎉

I'm thrilled to announce that my R package, bnns (Bayesian Neural Networks with Stan), has been accepted and is now available on CRAN! 📦✨

🌟 What is bnns?
 bnns provides a flexible, formula-based interface for building and training Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) using Stan. It empowers users to model complex relationships while quantifying uncertainty—a critical feature in high-stakes fields like clinical trials, finance, and more.

🌟 Why Use bnns?
 ✅ Easy-to-use formula interface
 ✅ Leverages the power of Bayesian inference for robust predictions
 ✅ Supports custom prior distributions for weights and other parameters
 ✅ Provides posterior distributions for uncertainty quantification
 ✅ Suitable for regression, binary classification, and multi-class classification problems
 ✅ Benchmark performance tested against popular datasets

🌟 Applications
 Whether you're working on a small dataset with limited observations or need interpretable, probabilistic predictions in your domain, bnns is designed to deliver powerful results.

🌟 Get Started
 Install bnns directly from CRAN with:
     install.packages("bnns")  

🌟 Learn More
 Explore the package documentation and examples to see how bnns can fit into your data science workflows.
