I am excited to announce that my team and I are the organisers of the upcoming #UAI 2023 workshop on "Epistemic Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence"

https://lnkd.in/ew9fUWrS

as part of our #horizon2020 Epistemic AI #EU project:

https://lnkd.in/grbkStWQ

E-pi@UAI 2023 aims to raise awareness around the modelling of epistemic #uncertainty in #AI and #machinelearning, a rapidly emerging topic in the #artificialintelligence community represented at UAI. 

As we aim for the broadest possible involvement, we invite the submission of peer-reviewed papers covering the following topics: 

- Model uncertainty estimation
- Robustness to distribution shift
- Out-of-distribution generalisation
- Model adaptation
- Datasets and protocols for evaluating uncertainty and #robustness 
- Conformal prediction
- Distribution-free uncertainty quantification
- #optimisation under uncertainty
- Uncertainty estimation using deep ensembles
- #bayesian #deeplearning (approximate inference, Bayesian deep #reinforcementlearning)
- Deep recognition models for #variational inference
- Epistemic learning
- Uncertainty in real-world applications (e.g. #autonomousdriving, #healthcare, #languagemodels).

The list is not exhaustive.

Papers submitted to E-pi@UAI 2023 will need to follow the UAI format. Submission takes place via CMT:

We will award prizes for the best paper and the best student paper, and consider the publication of a #proceedings volume, subject to attracting a sufficient number of high-quality papers.

The event features invited speaker of the calibre of Gert de Cooman (Ghent), Marco Zaffalon (IDSIA USI-SUPSI), Yarin Gal (University of Oxford) and Aaditya Ramdas (Carnegie Mellon University).
