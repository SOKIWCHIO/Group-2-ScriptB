Epistemic AI is getting traction!!
All the papers we submitted to ICLR'25 and AISTATS'25 got in (100%)! With this, all 5 papers originally submitted to NeurIPS in 2024 have been published in top venues. 
Congratulations to my fantastic team for the amazing result!

"Random-Set Neural Networks", led by Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal and Muhammad Mubashar, is a foundational paper proving that network which predict random sets, rather than probability vectors, are more accurate, robust, have better OOD detection and calibration rates than all competitors: Bayesian, Evidential, Ensembles, etc.

"Credal Wrapper of Model Averaging for Uncertainty Estimation In Classification", led by Kaizheng Wang with Keivan Shariatmadar PhD MSc BSc at #KULeuven, supervised by Hans Hallez and David Moens shows that wrapping up Bayesian and ensemble predictions in the form of a credal set (convex set of probabilities) improved uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution detection.

Last but not least, "A Unified Evaluation Framework for Epistemic Predictions", also led by Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal fills a huge gap in the field, by proposing a single coherent way of assessing and comparing predictions with attached level of uncertainty.
