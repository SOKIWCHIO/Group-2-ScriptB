Paper alert: Myrthe Leijnse identified the dynamics of water scarcity in major hotspots using causal inference and structural causal modelling. This work is related to Universiteit Utrecht’s work on the #WorldWaterMap with National Geographic Society.

Ever wondered what a Structural Causal Model (SCM) is - and how it can be applied to real-world water scarcity data? 🧐 
 
🗺️💧In our new publication, we built a causal model of water scarcity drivers across 21 global hotspots. Our findings confirm that population growth often has a stronger impact on water scarcity than climate factors, but also highlight challenges of causal modelling with limited data availability. 
 
Curious to dive deeper into the insights - and the struggles - of applying causality in practice?
