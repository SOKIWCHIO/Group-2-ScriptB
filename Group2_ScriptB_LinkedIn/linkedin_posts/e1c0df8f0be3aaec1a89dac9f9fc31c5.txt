When I was in University, I didn't really like Mathematics. Here in Nigeria, there's a popular phrase we say: "School na Scam." It means going to school is a scam. Most people say this because they don't understand how Mathematics is related to solving real-world problems. Some would say, "How would Matrices and dy/dx put food on my table? Abeg jhare" (Abeg jhare means "Please don't stress me"). This was the whole narrative, and it was shared by more than 70-80% of Nigerian students studying math-related courses.

But I saw things differently. As someone who's been in the AI field since university, I could see how mathematics aligned with solving real-world problems. I was able to help my friends understand this too, and I taught a few more people about the relationship.

I've collected some math concepts and their uses in the AI world. As I always say, "𝘈𝘐 𝘪𝘴𝘯'𝘵 𝘔𝘢𝘨𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭, 𝘈𝘐 𝘪𝘴 𝘔𝘢𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭."

Here's a list I compiled:

1. Matrices: Used in image processing and neural network computations
2. Vectors: Represent data points and features in machine learning
3. Linear equations: Solve optimization problems in AI
4. Probability: Used in decision-making algorithms and prediction models
5. Statistics: Analyze data patterns and model uncertainties
6. Calculus: Optimize machine learning algorithms
7. Logarithms: Used in various loss functions and information theory
8. Exponential functions: Applied in activation functions like sigmoid
9. Trigonometry: Used in signal processing and computer vision
10. Set theory: Helps in data organization and logic in AI systems
11. Graph theory: Applied in social network analysis and recommendation systems
12. Differential equations: Model complex systems and time-series data
13. Linear algebra: Fundamental in most machine learning algorithms
14. Geometry: Used in computer vision and robotics
15. Complex numbers: Applied
