Most machine learning frameworks are designed to provide predictions without quantifying uncertainty and usually don't infer a prediction interval. A common approach when uncertainty quantification is a must for a data product, is the incorporation of Bayesian methods. These methods though come at the cost of introducing subjective priors that often result in unreliable prediction intervals.
 
Fortunately, the machine learning domain is more active than ever and one of the most promising frameworks for uncertainty quantification is Conformal Prediction (CP). Being a fan of CP, I interacted with Valeriy Manokhin, one of the prominent ambassadors of this framework. I'm happy to share that I serve as a technical reviewer of his new book "Practical Guide to Applied Conformal Prediction", published by Packt.

If your machine learning project needs to provide prediction intervals and to quantify how uncertain your model is for its predictions, or you are just curious about how CP works, this book can quickly and intuitively introduce you to this fascinating framework.

The book will be released in a week, but you can already order it from Amazon :)
