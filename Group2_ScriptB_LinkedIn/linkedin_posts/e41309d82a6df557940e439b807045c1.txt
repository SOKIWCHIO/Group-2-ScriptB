Understanding and quantifying uncertainty in simulations of physical phenomena is a critical challenge, especially when the data is sparse, noisy, or the models are incomplete.

To address this, we developed a Monte Carlo ensemble physics-informed machine learning method. This framework allows us to accurately estimate the states and parameters of complex differential systems under total uncertainty, including aleatoric, epistemic, and model-form uncertainties. Our focus was on applying this to the CVSim-6 model in cardiovascular physiology, demonstrating robustness even with limited data.

Thank you to the co-authors, Zongren Zou, Daniele Schiavazzi, and George Karniadakis, for their invaluable contributions.

Congrats Team for this work! 

Can we do have a another study by using #openfoam.? If you share the CAD model (.step/.stl) then we can look into it.
