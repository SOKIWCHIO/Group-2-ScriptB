🚀 Research Paper Highlights: 'To Believe or Not to Believe Your LLM' by Yasin Abbasi et al from Google DeepMind.
Language models sometimes produce hallucinations or responses with low truthfulness that don't align with common knowledge. Since LLMs model a probability distribution over texts, we can address truthfulness through statistical uncertainty. This paper explores uncertainty quantification in LLMs, distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

1. Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs: This study introduces an information-theoretic metric to measure uncertainty in large language models (LLMs). This metric distinguishes between epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (randomness). It reliably detects high epistemic uncertainty, indicating unreliable model outputs, and is computed through iterative prompting.

2. Detection of Hallucinations: Their method effectively detects hallucinations—instances of high epistemic uncertainty—in both single- and multi-answer responses. Unlike standard strategies, it excels in detecting hallucinations in multi-answer scenarios, demonstrating significant advantages through extensive experiments.

3. Limitations of Existing Approaches: Existing uncertainty quantification methods struggle with scenarios involving multiple correct responses due to aleatoric uncertainty. They cannot differentiate between large aleatoric uncertainty in a perfect predictor and large epistemic uncertainty in a poor predictor.

4. Innovative Solution: By utilizing iterative prompting, they have developed an information-theoretic metric to measure epistemic uncertainty in large language models (LLMs). This metric assesses the difference between the distribution of responses generated by the LLM and the actual ground truth. It remains unaffected by aleatoric uncertainty, allowing to accurately gauge epistemic uncertainty even whe
