Discover how mathematical engineering inspired by the Riemann Hypothesis could revolutionize AI, potentially accelerating the convergence of slow algorithms in deep neural networks and transformer models. Vincent Granville's research introduces a novel approach to data synthetization and a universal function rivaling those in modern DNNs, offering a new path to solve a 150-year-old problem.

🚀 From Brain to Machines: The History of CNNs 🧠➡️💻

Today, I explored how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were inspired by our own brains and the fascinating journey behind them.

🔹 In the 1960s, neuroscientists Hubel & Wiesel discovered that neurons in the visual cortex react to edges, lines, and simple shapes, and as signals go deeper, they respond to more complex patterns.
 This hierarchical processing in the brain became the foundation for CNNs.

🔹 In the 1980s, Kunihiko Fukushima developed the Neocognitron, an early version of CNNs with convolution and pooling layers.

🔹 In the 1990s, Yann LeCun built LeNet-5, one of the first successful CNNs, used for handwritten digit recognition (like reading bank checks).

✨ Key insight: Vision works hierarchically —

Early layers detect edges/textures
Middle layers detect patterns/shapes
Deeper layers detect objects

That’s why CNNs power modern applications like object detection, facial recognition, and self-driving cars.
It’s fascinating how ideas from neuroscience evolved into technology that drives today’s AI world. 🌍🤖
