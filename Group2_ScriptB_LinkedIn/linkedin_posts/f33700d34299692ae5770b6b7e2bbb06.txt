Sometimes it's one step forward and two steps back.

Since my last update of pmf2speciate, I've taken a step back to re-evaluate how I'm categorizing and grouping the SPECIATE dataset. A number of the profiles in the database are really just different samples of the same source, but with slightly different names (ex, "Biomass Burning - Wildfire", "Wildfire", "Forest Fire").

With the help of an LLM, I wrangled these 6,000 samples into more solid groups, which I'll now train the RF model on. I also built a Plotly visualization tool to view which compounds contribute >5% to different sources.

Some thoughts & lessons learned along the way:
☑️ LLMs are amazingly effective at tedious tasks like grouping similar terms. Without it, the manual review would've taken weeks (and honestly, I probably wouldn't have done it).
☑️ If you're building datasets, think ahead to the people who will want to use them programmatically. Free-text fields make downstream use so much harder.
☑️ A quick visualization makes it so much easier to sanity-check data and spot issues early.

Follow along for more updates!

New tool alert: convert-ts-bash-history.py

This script processes one or more .bash_history files and outputs a pipe-separated values (PSV) list that summarizes command histories by filename and timestamp. It’s a straightforward way to
