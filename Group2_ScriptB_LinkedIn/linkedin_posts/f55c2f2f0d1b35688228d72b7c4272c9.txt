🤔 Most AI models make confident predictions even when they’re wrong.
But in the real world, 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐲 𝐢𝐬𝐧’𝐭 𝐚 𝐛𝐮𝐠; 𝐢𝐭’𝐬 𝐚 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞.

🎭 The difference between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty matters.
🔖 𝐄𝐩𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐲 comes from missing knowledge it can be reduced with more data. 
🔖 𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐜 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐲 comes from randomness—it’s irreducible. 

❌ Treating them the same leads to bad decisions.

📊 Bayesian methods bring 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐲.
From Bayesian linear regression to Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, probabilistic AI explicitly models what the system knows and doesn’t. 

✅ This makes decision-making more reliable.

🔄 Probabilistic AI shines in sequential decision-making.
🔹𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 reduces data collection costs by focusing only on the most informative samples.
🔹𝐁𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 balances exploration vs. exploitation, improving resource allocation.
🔹𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥-𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 learning integrates uncertainty to guide exploration safely.

📖 These aren’t just theoretical ideas. The recent ETH Zürich course on Probabilistic AI (by Andreas Krause & Jonas Hübotter) dives deep into these methods, showing how 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 can complement each other.

🏆At 𝐏𝐲𝐌𝐂 𝐋𝐚𝐛𝐬, we’re actively working at the forefront of 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐀𝐈 + 𝐁𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠, making AI not just predictive, but uncertainty-aware and interpretable.

Very interesting distinction about different kinds of uncertainty.
