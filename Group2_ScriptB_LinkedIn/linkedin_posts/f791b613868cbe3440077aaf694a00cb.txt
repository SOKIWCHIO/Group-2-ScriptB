When you ask an LLM to generate JSON, you choose the quality of the container over the quality of the content. The way LLMs are fine-tuned (binary preferences) you cannot have both.

In my experience, this just isn’t true. Asking LLMs to write their output as JSON sometimes even improves the quality of the output, possibly because it has better JSON training data.

In fact, ultimately the claim "you can't have both json and quality" is like saying "you can't have bulletpoints and quality": it’s just formatting, why should it negatively affect output quality?

How would people do that? I guess you would first produce the "content" and then fit it to the "container". But even there, I would not trust an API endpoint that doesn't guarantee you syntactically correct output.

So you are saying to have a high quality output  just get the raw output and then ask it to format it as a json?
