A Frequentist embracing Bayesian methods: My Journey in Biostatistics

As someone who began their statistical journey firmly in the frequentist paradigm, I’ve grown to deeply appreciate the elegance and practicality of Bayesian methods—a shift inspired by gems like the 𝘉𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘢𝘯 𝘉𝘪𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘴 textbook. The evolution of biostatistics over recent years has been nothing short of revolutionary, with Bayesian approaches playing a starring role. Here’s why this paradigm resonates with me—and why it might for you, too:

𝟭. 𝗕𝗮𝘆𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱𝘀 𝗠𝗶𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆
The Bayesian framework’s ability to incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs as new data emerges aligns seamlessly with the iterative nature of scientific research. Unlike frequentist methods, which often treat parameters as fixed unknowns, Bayesian statistics quantifies uncertainty probabilistically—a natural fit for complex, real-world biomedical problems.

𝟮. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗠𝗲𝗲𝘁𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
Advances in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms and tools like Stan have transformed Bayesian analysis from a theoretical ideal into a daily workhorse. The 𝘉𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘢𝘯 𝘉𝘪𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘴 text brilliantly bridges theory and application.

To my fellow biostatisticians: Have you incorporated Bayesian approaches into your work? What computational tools have you found most effective?
