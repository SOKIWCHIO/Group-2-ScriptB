Conformal prediction is probably one of the best approaches to quantify the uncertainty of your ML models!

Why? 

✅ Guaranteed coverage: Prediction regions generated by conformal prediction come with coverage guarantees of the true outcome

✅ Easy to use: Conformal prediction can easily be implemented within a couple of lines of code

✅ Model Agnostic: Works with any machine learning model

✅ Distribution free: This method makes no assumption regarding the underlying distribution of the data

✅ No retraining: Can be used without retraining the model 

✅ Broad applications: It works for classification, regression, time series forecasting and many other tasks

Want to learn more and get started? Here are three resources: 

1️⃣ Strongly recommend “Introduction to Conformal Prediction with Python” by Christoph Molnar (from which this post is inspired)
2️⃣ The Mapie Python library to easily quantify the uncertainty of your ML models: https://lnkd.in/eJd4-jBV
3️⃣ This great repository by Valeriy Manokhin, PhD, MBA, CQF. https://lnkd.in/e2tFkPmA

Which method do you usually use to quantify the uncertainty of your models? Do you think that conformal prediction is a good choice? Let me know in the comments.

If you are using conformal prediction, make sure to avoid the common missteps  discussed here:

I would also recommend the python library crepes. It is the only library with the super powerful Conformal Predictive Systems https://github.com/h
