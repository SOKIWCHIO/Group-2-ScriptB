🔬 New Publication on AI-Driven Modeling for Concrete Durability 🧱
Predicting the long-term durability of concrete structures remains a key challenge in civil engineering, particularly due to the complex and uncertain nature of aggressive ion ingress (e.g., chlorides and sulfates). From both an AI modeling and materials science perspective, accounting for such uncertainty—while maintaining reliability—has been a persistent gap in current methods.
Our recent study, now published in Construction and Building Materials, presents a data-driven framework that addresses this challenge by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for dataset augmentation and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for uncertainty-aware prediction.

We hope this work contributes to the growing field of AI in infrastructure resilience and opens further opportunities for integrating generative and probabilistic AI models into material durability research.
