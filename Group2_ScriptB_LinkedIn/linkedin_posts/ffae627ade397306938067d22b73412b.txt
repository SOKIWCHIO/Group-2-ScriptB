🔍 Understanding #CNN Decisions in #Spectroscopy with #Grad-CAM

In deep learning, especially when working with spectral data, models like Convolutional Neural Networks  can achieve impressive predictions. But how do we know what the model is really looking at? 

One powerful tool is Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping). Grad-CAM allows us to visualize which wavelengths contribute most to a prediction. 

💡 In practice, we can:
Generate Grad-CAM for each Conv1D layer to see how feature importance evolves.

Average heatmaps across samples to get class-level insights.

Compare early vs late layers to understand hierarchical feature extraction.

Grad-CAM helps build trust in models and guides better model design and spectral interpretation.
