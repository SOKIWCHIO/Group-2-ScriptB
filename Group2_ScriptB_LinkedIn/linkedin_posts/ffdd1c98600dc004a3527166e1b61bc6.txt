📢 New Beta Estimation Method! "Can Machine Learning Methods Predict Beta?" How ML can help in beta estimation for non-traded assets. Keep reading! 🔻

This paper presents a new approach to beta estimation, using ML to vastly improve accuracy for private and non-traded firms.

The main contributions and findings are as follows:

👉 Machine Learning Beta Estimation: The paper compares traditional Comparable Company Analysis (CCA) with five machine learning (ML) algorithms for estimating beta, including decision tree ensembles and neural networks.

👉 Dramatic Error Reduction: The ML models significantly reduce mean absolute error (MAE) by up to 42% compared to CCA, with particularly strong performance for smaller, younger firms—those that typically differ most from their peer groups.

👉 Outperformance in Non-Traded Asset Valuation: ML methods outperform traditional accounting betas and provide better estimates for firms with unconventional capital structures, making them ideal for private firm valuations.

👉 Robustness Across Models: The study proves the robustness of ML results even with fewer predictors and demonstrates that the Light GBM method performs best, consistently improving forecast accuracy across different firm sizes and ages.
