Abstract:
In astrophysics, line opacity is a primary source of uncertainty in theoretical calculations of radiative transfer. Much of this uncertainty is dominated by the inability to resolve the width and separation in frequency of sharp atomic transition lines, leading to the common use of approximate frequency-averaged treatments for the lines. In a previous paper, we calculated shock-cooling emission following explosions in core-collapse supernovae using a mult-group radiative transfer code, and compared the results to those of the similar and often used STELLA code from the literature. We found important differences in the spectral energy distribution (SED) resulting from different choices of line opacity treatment. In our code, we used in the emissivity a frequency-binned average of a high-resolution opacity, while in STELLA the often-used Eastman Pinto 1993 (EP93) prescription was employed. In this short letter we revisit this comparison, essentially reproducing STELLA bound-free (photoionization) and bound-bound (line transition) opacities. We show the importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the equation of state (EOS). We also argue that EP93 is useful for estimating photon mean free-path in the presence of a forest of lines, but that it can underestimate photon production and reprocessing rates (emissivity) by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution currently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent opacity table.
