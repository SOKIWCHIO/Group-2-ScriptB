Abstract:
Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) have shown that language model (LM) based systems offer competitive performance compared to traditional approaches. However, in training, TTS models use ground-truth (GT) tokens as prefixes to predict the next token, while in inference these tokens are not available, a gap between training and inference that is often neglected. In this study, we propose a prompt-guided hybrid training scheme to mitigate exposure bias in popular LM-based TTS systems. Our core idea is to adopt a hybrid training paradigm that combines teacher forcing with free running, thereby introducing self-generated tokens into the training process. This makes the training mode more consistent with inference, reducing the training-inference gap. In addition, we incorporate an EOS prediction mechanism during training to detect incorrect sequence termination and adaptively control the free running process. Experimental results provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of exposure bias on LM-based TTS, and demonstrate that our method effectively narrows the training-inference gap, thereby improving the quality of synthesized long-form speech.
