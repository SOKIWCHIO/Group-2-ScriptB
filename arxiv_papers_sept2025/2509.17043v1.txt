Abstract:
The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) fundamentally encodes the geometry and topology of quantum states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. While adiabatic perturbation theory links its real part (quantum metric) and imaginary part (Berry curvature) to energy fluctuations and generalized forces, respectively, in Hermitian systems, direct measurement of the QGT, which defined using both left and right eigenstates of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, remains challenging. Here we develop two quantum simulation schemes to directly extract all components of the QGT in pseudo-Hermitian systems with real spectra. Each scheme independently determines the complete QGT using generalized expectation values of either the energy fluctuation operator or the generalized force operator with respect to two time-evolved states prepared through distinct nonadiabatic evolutions, thereby establishing two self-contained measurement protocols. We illustrate the validity of these schemes on two $q$-deformed 2-band models: one with nontrivial topology, and the other with a nonvanishing off-diagonal quantum metric. Numerical simulations show that both schemes achieve high-fidelity agreement with theoretical predictions for measuring the QGT of both models, and successfully capture the topological phase transition of the first model using Chern numbers calculated from Berry curvatures. This work provides a framework for extending dynamical measurement schemes from Hermitian to pseudo-Hermitian systems with real spectra.
