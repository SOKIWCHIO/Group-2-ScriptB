Abstract:
Contact-rich manipulation is crucial for robots to perform tasks requiring precise force control, such as insertion, assembly, and in-hand manipulation. However, most imitation learning (IL) policies remain position-centric and lack explicit force awareness, and adding force/torque sensors to collaborative robot arms is often costly and requires additional hardware design. To overcome these issues, we propose FILIC, a Force-guided Imitation Learning framework with impedance torque control. FILIC integrates a Transformer-based IL policy with an impedance controller in a dual-loop structure, enabling compliant force-informed, force-executed manipulation. For robots without force/torque sensors, we introduce a cost-effective end-effector force estimator using joint torque measurements through analytical Jacobian-based inversion while compensating with model-predicted torques from a digital twin. We also design complementary force feedback frameworks via handheld haptics and VR visualization to improve demonstration quality. Experiments show that FILIC significantly outperforms vision-only and joint-torque-based methods, achieving safer, more compliant, and adaptable contact-rich manipulation.
