Abstract:
Subsurface lithological heterogeneity presents challenges for traditional geophysical methods, particularly in resolving nonlinear electrical resistivity and induced polarization (IP) relationships. This study introduces a data-driven machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) framework for predicting 2D IP chargeability models from resistivity, depth, and station distance, reducing reliance on field IP surveys. The framework integrates ensemble regressors with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) enhanced by global average pooling. Among the tested models, CatBoost achieved the highest prediction accuracy (R^2 = 0.942 training, 0.945 testing), closely followed by random forest, while the stacked ML/DL ensemble further improved performance, particularly for complex resistivity-IP behaviors. Overall accuracy ranged from R^2 = 0.882 to 0.947 with RMSE < 0.04. Integration with k-means clustering enhanced lithological discrimination, effectively delineating sandy silt, silty sand, and weathered granite influenced by saturation, clay content, and fracturing. This scalable approach provides a rapid solution for subsurface modeling in exploration, geotechnical, and environmental applications.
