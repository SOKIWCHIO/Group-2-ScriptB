Abstract:
Identifying multivariate dependencies in high-dimensional data is an important problem in large-scale inference. This problem has motivated recent advances in mining (partial) correlations, which focus on the challenging ultra-high dimensional setting where the sample size, n, is fixed, while the number of features, p, grows without bound. The state-of-the-art method for partial correlation screening can lead to undesirable results. This paper introduces a novel principled framework for partial correlation screening with error control (PARSEC), which leverages the connection between partial correlations and regression coefficients. We establish the inferential properties of PARSEC when n is fixed and p grows super-exponentially. First, we provide "fixed-n-large-p" asymptotic expressions for the familywise error rate (FWER) and k-FWER. Equally importantly, our analysis leads to a novel discovery which permits the calculation of exact marginal p-values for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), and also the positive FDR (pFDR). To our knowledge, no other competing approach in the "fixed-n large-p" setting allows for error control across the spectrum of multiple hypothesis testing metrics. We establish the computational complexity of PARSEC and rigorously demonstrate its scalability to the large p setting. The theory and methods are successfully validated on simulated and real data, and PARSEC is shown to outperform the current state-of-the-art.
