Abstract:
In this work, a theoretical scheme on quantum molecular dynamics in curved Schwarzschild spacetime is developed. To this end, the gravitational field is introduced by revising the kinetics energy operator (KEO) rather than by adding Newtonian gravitational interaction in the potential energy surface (PES) due to the important role of the metric tensor in deriving the KEO. To test the present Schr{\"o}dinger-type framework, spherically symmetric Schwarzschild spacetime is chosen to explore (1) the H + H$_2$ reaction dynamics, (2) the H$_2$ + H$_2$ scattering dynamics, (3) dynamics of dissociative chemsorption of H$_2$O on Cu(111), and (4) the spectrum band of anthracene cation. Extensive numerical calculations in curved space predict that reaction or scattering probability and spectrum band decrease abruptly to zero as the gravitational strength increases, indicating the remarkable role of gravitational field in chemical dynamics and naturally leading to effects of gravitational time dilation of the molecular systems. However, it is noteworthy that moderate gravitational field can significantly enhance dynamical resonance in the low-energy region, if such resonance exists in flat space. Finally, based on the present numerical results discussions on the quantum molecular dynamics in curved space are given.
