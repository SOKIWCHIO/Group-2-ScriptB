Abstract:
Agile mapless navigation in cluttered 3D environments poses significant challenges for autonomous drones. Conventional mapping-planning-control pipelines incur high computational cost and propagate estimation errors. We present AERO-MPPI, a fully GPU-accelerated framework that unifies perception and planning through an anchor-guided ensemble of Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) optimizers. Specifically, we design a multi-resolution LiDAR point-cloud representation that rapidly extracts spatially distributed "anchors" as look-ahead intermediate endpoints, from which we construct polynomial trajectory guides to explore distinct homotopy path classes. At each planning step, we run multiple MPPI instances in parallel and evaluate them with a two-stage multi-objective cost that balances collision avoidance and goal reaching. Implemented entirely with NVIDIA Warp GPU kernels, AERO-MPPI achieves real-time onboard operation and mitigates the local-minima failures of single-MPPI approaches. Extensive simulations in forests, verticals, and inclines demonstrate sustained reliable flight above 7 m/s, with success rates above 80% and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Real-world experiments on a LiDAR-equipped quadrotor with NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16G confirm that AERO-MPPI runs in real time onboard and consistently achieves safe, agile, and robust flight in complex cluttered environments. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance of the paper.
