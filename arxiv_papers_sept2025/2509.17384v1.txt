Abstract:
In the momentarily comoving frame of a cosmological fluid, the determinant of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) is highly sensitive to its pressure. This component is significant during radiation-dominated epochs, and becomes naturally negligible as the universe transitions to the matter-dominated era. Here, we investigate the cosmological consequences of gravity sourced by the determinant of the EMT. Unlike Azri and Nasri, Phys. Lett. B 836, 137626 (2023), we consider the most general case in which the second derivative of the perfect-fluid Lagrangian does not vanish. We derive the gravitational field equations for the general power-law case and examine the cosmological implications of the scale-independent model characterized by dimensionless couplings to photons and neutrinos. We show that, unlike various theories based on the EMT, the present setup, which leads to an enhanced gravitational effects of radiation, does not alter the time evolution of the energy density of particle species. Furthermore, we confront the model with the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis, and discuss its potential to alleviate the Hubble tension by reducing the sound horizon. The radiation-gravity couplings we propose here are expected to yield testable cosmological and astrophysical signatures, probing whether gravity distinguishes between relativistic and nonrelativistic species in the early universe.
