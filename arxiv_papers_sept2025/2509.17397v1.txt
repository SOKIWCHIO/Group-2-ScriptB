Abstract:
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are vital for reliable urban positioning. However, multipath and non-line-of-sight reception often introduce large measurement errors that degrade accuracy. Learning-based methods for predicting and compensating pseudorange errors have gained traction, but their performance is limited by complex error distributions. To address this challenge, we propose Diff-GNSS, a coarse-to-fine GNSS measurement (pseudorange) error estimation framework that leverages a conditional diffusion model to capture such complex distributions. Firstly, a Mamba-based module performs coarse estimation to provide an initial prediction with appropriate scale and trend. Then, a conditional denoising diffusion layer refines the estimate, enabling fine-grained modeling of pseudorange errors. To suppress uncontrolled generative diversity and achieve controllable synthesis, three key features related to GNSS measurement quality are used as conditions to precisely guide the reverse denoising process. We further incorporate per-satellite uncertainty modeling within the diffusion stage to assess the reliability of the predicted errors. We have collected and publicly released a real-world dataset covering various scenes. Experiments on public and self-collected datasets show that DiffGNSS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to pseudorange error estimation. The proposed diffusion-based refinement module is plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing networks to markedly improve estimation accuracy.
