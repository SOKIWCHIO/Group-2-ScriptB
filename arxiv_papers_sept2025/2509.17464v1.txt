Abstract:
Predicting the Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$) of magnetic materials is crucial for advancing applications in data storage, spintronics, and sensors. We present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict $T_{\mathrm{C}}$ using a curated dataset of 2,500 ferromagnetic compounds, employing two types of elemental descriptor-based features: one based on stoichiometry-weighted descriptors, and the other leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). CatBoost trained on the stoichiometry-weighted descriptors achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.87, while the use of GNN-based representations led to a further improvement, with CatBoost reaching an $R^2$ of 0.91, highlighting the effectiveness of graph-based feature learning. We also demonstrated that using an uncurated dataset available online leads to poor predictions, resulting in a low $R^2$ score of 0.66 for the CatBoost model. We analyzed feature importance using tools such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which revealed that ionization energies are a key physicochemical factor influencing $T_\mathrm{C}$. Notably, the use of only the first 10 ionization energies as input features resulted in high predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ scores of up to 0.85 for statistical models and 0.89 for the GNN-based approach. These results highlight that combining robust ML models with thoughtful feature engineering and high-quality data, can accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials. Our curated dataset is publicly available on GitHub.
