Abstract:
We investigate the partonic origin of the proton longitudinal spin using spin-dependent energy correlator measured in lepton-hadron collisions with longitudinally polarized proton beams. These observables encode angular correlations in energy flow and are sensitive to the spin-momentum structure of confined partons. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns in both nearly back-to-back and forward limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with longitudinally polarized transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) and nucleon energy correlators (NECs). The TMDs and NECs allow consistent matching onto hard radiation region, and provide a comprehensive description of the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint $\text{N}^{3}$LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for spin-dependent energy correlation patterns in the current and target fragmentation regions (CFR and TFR). The framework provides new theoretical insight into how the internal motion and spin of partons contribute to the formation of the proton longitudinal spin, and offers an experimental paradigm for probing the interplay between color confinement and spin dynamics at forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).
