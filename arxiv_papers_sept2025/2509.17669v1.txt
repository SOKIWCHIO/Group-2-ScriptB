Abstract:
With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Controllable Text Generation (CTG) has become a critical technology for enhancing system reliability and user experience. Addressing the limitations of traditional methods, this paper proposes the PG-CE (Progressive Generation with Constraint Enhancement) approach, which decomposes CTG tasks into three steps: type prediction, constraint construction, and guided generation. This method employs constraint generation models to dynamically build multi-dimensional constraints including tone, expression style, and thematic focus to guide output. Experiments demonstrate that PG-CE significantly improves generation quality across multiple scenarios while maintaining text controllability, thematic relevance, and response practicality. The research developed a dataset containing 90,000 constraint-text pairs (with an 8:2 ratio between daily and other topics), effectively reflecting real-world application requirements.
