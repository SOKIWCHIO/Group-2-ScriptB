Abstract:
Depth imaging is a crucial area in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), as it plays a key role in detecting and measuring objects in the vehicle's surroundings. However, a significant challenge in this domain arises from missing information in Depth images, where certain points are not measurable due to gaps or inconsistencies in pixel data. Our research addresses two key tasks to overcome this challenge. First, we developed an algorithm using a multi-layered training approach to generate Depth images from a single RGB image. Second, we addressed the issue of missing information in Depth images by applying our algorithm to rectify these gaps, resulting in Depth images with complete and accurate data. We further tested our algorithm on the Cityscapes dataset and successfully resolved the missing information in its Depth images, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world urban environments.
