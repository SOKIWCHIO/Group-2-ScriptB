Abstract:
Optimizing and refining action execution through   exploration and interaction is a promising way for robotic   manipulation. However, practical approaches to interaction driven robotic learning are still underexplored, particularly for   long-horizon tasks where sequential decision-making, physical   constraints, and perceptual uncertainties pose significant chal lenges. Motivated by embodied cognition theory, we propose   RoboSeek, a framework for embodied action execution that   leverages interactive experience to accomplish manipulation   tasks. RoboSeek optimizes prior knowledge from high-level   perception models through closed-loop training in simulation   and achieves robust real-world execution via a real2sim2real   transfer pipeline. Specifically, we first replicate real-world   environments in simulation using 3D reconstruction to provide   visually and physically consistent environments., then we train   policies in simulation using reinforcement learning and the   cross-entropy method leveraging visual priors. The learned   policies are subsequently deployed on real robotic platforms   for execution. RoboSeek is hardware-agnostic and is evaluated   on multiple robotic platforms across eight long-horizon ma nipulation tasks involving sequential interactions, tool use, and   object handling. Our approach achieves an average success rate   of 79%, significantly outperforming baselines whose success   rates remain below 50%, highlighting its generalization and   robustness across tasks and platforms. Experimental results   validate the effectiveness of our training framework in complex,   dynamic real-world settings and demonstrate the stability of the   proposed real2sim2real transfer mechanism, paving the way for   more generalizable embodied robotic learning.
