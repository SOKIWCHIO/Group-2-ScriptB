Abstract:
The behavior of honeybees is an important ecological phenomenon not only in terms of honey and beeswax production but also due to the proliferation of flora and fauna around it. The best way to study this significant phenomenon is by non-invasive monitoring of beehives using the sounds produced by various body movements that give out audio signals which can be exploited for various predictions related to the objectives mentioned above. This study investigates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks to classify and monitor different hive states with the help of joint time and frequency image representations such as Spectrogram, Mel-Spectrogram, Smoothed-Spectrogram, and Cochleagram. Our findings indicate that the Cochleagram outperformed all the other representations, achieving an accuracy of 98.31% on unseen data. Furthermore, we employed various strategies including pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to optimize the network and prevent any potential issues with model size. With these optimizations, the network size was lowered by 91.8% and the inference time was accelerated by 66%, increasing its suitability for real-time applications. Thus our study emphasizes the significance of using optimization approaches to minimize model size, avoid deployment problems, and expedite inference for real-time application as well as the selection of an appropriate time-frequency representation for optimal performance.
