Abstract:
Accurate prediction of molecular properties in complex chemical systems is crucial for accelerating material discovery and chemical innovation.However,current computational methods often struggle to capture the intricate compositional interplay across complex chemical systems,from intramolecular bonds to intermolecular forces.In this work,we introduce MesoNet,a novel framework founded on the principle of multi-representation learning and specifically designed for multi-molecule modeling.The core innovation of MesoNet lies in the construction of context-aware representation-dynamically enriched atomic descriptors generated via Neural Circuit Policies. These parameters efficiently capture both intrinsic atomic properties and their dynamic compositional context through a cross-attention mechanism spanning both intramolecular and intermolecular message passing. Driven by this mechanism,the influence of the mixed system is progressively applied to each molecule and atom, making message passing both efficient and meaningful.Comprehensive evaluations across diverse public datasets, spanning both pure components and mixtures,demonstrate that MesoNet achieves superior accuracy and enhanced chemical interpretability for molecular properties.This work establishes a powerful,interpretable approach for modeling compositional complexity,aiming to advance chemical simulation and design.
