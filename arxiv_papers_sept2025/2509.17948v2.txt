Abstract:
Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.
