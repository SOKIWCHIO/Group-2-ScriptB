Abstract:
Meta-learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging information across related tasks to improve predictive performance on new tasks. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing meta-learning through the lens of predictor subspace characterization and quantification of task diversity. Specifically, we model the shared structure across tasks using a latent subspace and introduce a measure of diversity that captures heterogeneity across task-specific predictors. We provide both simulation-based and theoretical evidence indicating that achieving the desired prediction accuracy in meta-learning depends on the proportion of predictor variance aligned with the shared subspace, as well as on the accuracy of subspace estimation.
