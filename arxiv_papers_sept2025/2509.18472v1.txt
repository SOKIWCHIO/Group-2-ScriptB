Abstract:
RISC-V ISA-based processors have recently emerged as both powerful and energy-efficient computing platforms. The release of the MILK-V Pioneer marked a significant milestone as the first desktop-grade RISC-V system. With increasing engagement from both academia and industry, such platforms exhibit strong potential for adoption in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.   The open-source, FPGA-accelerated FireSim framework has emerged as a flexible and scalable tool for architectural exploration, enabling simulation of various system configurations using RISC-V cores. Despite its capabilities, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation regarding the feasibility and performance prediction accuracy of FireSim when compared to physical hardware.   In this study, we address this gap by modeling a commercially available single-board computer and a desktop-grade RISC-V CPU within FireSim. To ensure fidelity between simulation and real hardware, we first measure the performance of a series of benchmarks to compare runtime behavior under single-core and four-core configurations. Based on the closest matching simulation parameters, we subsequently evaluate performance using a representative mini-application and the LAMMPS molecular dynamics code.   Our findings indicate that while FireSim provides valuable insights into architectural performance trends, discrepancies remain between simulated and measured runtimes. These deviations stem from both inherent limitations of the simulation environment and the restricted availability of detailed performance specifications from CPU manufacturers, which hinder precise configuration matching.
