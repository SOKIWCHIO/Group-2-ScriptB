Abstract:
Porous materials exhibit vast structural diversity and support critical applications in gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, predictive modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical environments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined with sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across material families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels, including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization. ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.
