Abstract:
Safety remains a major concern for deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world applications. Simulators provide safe, scalable training environments, but the inevitable sim-to-real gap introduces additional safety concerns, as policies must satisfy constraints in real-world conditions that differ from simulation. To address this challenge, robust safe RL techniques offer principled methods, but are often incompatible with standard scalable training pipelines. In contrast, domain randomization, a simple and popular sim-to-real technique, stands out as a promising alternative, although it often results in unsafe behaviors in practice. We present SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.
