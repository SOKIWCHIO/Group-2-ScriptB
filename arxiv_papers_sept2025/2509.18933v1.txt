Abstract:
Wireless communications are characterized by their unpredictability, posing challenges for maintaining consistent communication quality. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various prediction models, with a focus on achieving accurate and efficient Wi-Fi link quality forecasts using machine learning techniques. Specifically, the paper evaluates the performance of data-driven models based on the linear combination of exponential moving averages, which are designed for low-complexity implementations and are then suitable for hardware platforms with limited processing resources. Accuracy of the proposed approaches was assessed using experimental data from a real-world Wi-Fi testbed, considering both channel-dependent and channel-independent training data. Remarkably, channel-independent models, which allow for generalized training by equipment manufacturers, demonstrated competitive performance. Overall, this study provides insights into the practical deployment of machine learning-based prediction models for enhancing Wi-Fi dependability in industrial environments.
