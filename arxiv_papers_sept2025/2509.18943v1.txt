Abstract:
Studying critical states in quasiperiodic systems is of great importance in localization physics. Previously identified critical states share a common characteristic: they exhibit persistent critical features in the thermodynamic limit. In this Letter, we predict an exotic type of critical state, termed size-dependent critical states, which exhibit a fundamentally distinct behavior. Specifically, they display critical localization signatures only at finite sizes, but transition to Anderson localization in the thermodynamic limit. We establish that the physical origin of size-dependent critical states lies in the synergistic interplay between local non-reciprocal domain wall and NHSE. By revealing a critical phase that challenges the established paradigm of critical localization, our work opens new avenues for exploring localization phenomena in quasiperiodic systems.
