Abstract:
The model minority myth obscures the educational disparities among Asian student groups in physics education. This study estimated the variation in conceptual physics knowledge across 19 Asian racial/ethnic groups at the start and end of introductory physics courses. Utilizing data from the LASSO platform, we analyzed responses from 16,810 students enrolled in 493 introductory calculus-based physics courses across 64 U.S. institutions. We applied Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) to analyze the student outcomes with the Force Concept Inventory and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. We found that the predicted posttest score of the lowest performing group is the same as the predicted pretest score of the highest performing group. Disaggregated data reveal performance differences among Asian groups that aggregated reporting conceals. To avoid the challenges that can arise when disaggregating data, instructors and researchers must consider many factors, such as research questions and/or methodological constraints. By leveraging the expanded identity options within the LASSO platform and the MAIHDA model, our approach offers a powerful framework for exposing hidden disparities and advancing equity in STEM education.
