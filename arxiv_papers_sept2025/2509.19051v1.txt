Abstract:
In this article, a failure mode dependent and thermodynamically consistent continuum damage model with polynomial-based damage hardening functions is proposed for continuum damage modeling of laminated composite panels. The damage model parameters are characterized based on all uniaxial/shear experimental stress-strain curves. Steepest descent optimization algorithm is used to minimize the difference between model predicted and experimental stress-strain curves to get the optimzed model parameters. The fully characterized damage evolution equations are used for damage prediction of a moderately thick laminated composite curved beam modeled using first-order shear deformation theory. Finite element method with load control is used to get the non-linear algebraic equations which are solved using Newton Raphson method. The developed model is compared with the existing failure mode dependent and failure mode independent damage models. The results depict the efficacy of the proposed model to capture non-linearity in the load vs deflection curve due to stiffness degradation and different damage in tension andcompression consistent with uniaxial/shear stress-strain response and strength properties of the material, respectively.
