Abstract:
We numerically study excitation transfer in an artificial LH1--RC complex -- an $N$-site donor ring coupled to a central acceptor -- driven by a narrowband optical mode and evolved under a Lindblad master equation with loss and dephasing. In the absence of disorder, the light-driven system exhibits a tall, narrow on-resonance efficiency peak (near unity for our parameters); dephasing lowers and narrows this peak without shifting its position. Off resonance, the efficiency shows environmentally assisted transport with a clear non-monotonic dependence on dephasing and a finite optimum. Under static disorder, two regimes emerge: photon--ring coupling and diagonal energetic disorder mix the drive into dark ring modes, activate dissipative channels, and depress efficiency over a detuning window, whereas intra-ring coupling disorder has a much smaller impact in the tested range; increasing the intra-ring coupling $g$ moves dark-mode crossings away from the operating detuning and restores near-peak performance. In the ordered, symmetric, single-excitation, narrowband limit we \emph{analytically derive} closed-form transfer efficiencies by projecting onto the $k{=}0$ bright mode and solving the photon--bright mode--acceptor trimer via a Laplace/linear-algebra (determinant) formula; these expressions include a probability-conservation identity $\eta + \sum_k L_k = 1$ that benchmarks the simulations and quantitatively predicts the resonant line shape and its dephasing-induced narrowing. A minimal ring toy model further reproduces coherent trapping and its relief by moderate dephasing (ENAQT). These analytics are exact in the ordered limit and serve as mechanistic guides outside this limit, yielding practical design rules for robust, bio-inspired light-harvesting devices.
