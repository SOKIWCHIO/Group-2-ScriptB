Abstract:
In Titan's atmosphere, the chemistry of small hydrocarbons and nitriles represent an important link from molecular species to the ubiquitous organic haze that gives Titan its characteristic yellow color. Here we present a new search for two previously undetected molecules, triacetylene (C$_{6}$H$_{2}$) and the gas phase dicyanoacetylene (C$_{4}$N$_{2}$), using the Echelon-Cross-Echelle Spectrograph (EXES) instrument aboard the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy) aircraft. We do not detect these two molecules but determine upper limits for their mixing ratios and column abundances. We find the $3\sigma$ upper limits on the uniform volume mixing ratio (VMR) above 100 km for C$_{6}$H$_{2}$ to be $4.3\times10^{-11}$ which is lower than the photochemical model predictions. This new upper limit suggests that the growth of linear molecules is inhibited. We also put a strict upper limit on the uniform VMR for gas phase C$_{4}$N$_{2}$ above 125 km to be $1.0\times10^{-10}$. This upper limit is well below the saturation mixing ratio at this altitude for C$_{4}$N$_{2}$ and greatly limits the feasibility of C$_{4}$N$_{2}$ forming ice from condensation.
