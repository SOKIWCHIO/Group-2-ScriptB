Abstract:
Our understanding of the origin of heavy elements beyond iron relies on the rapid neutron capture process (r-process), which accounts for roughly half of their cosmic abundance. However, the extreme neutron-rich conditions required for the r-process involve many nuclei that remain experimentally inaccessible, making theoretical predictions essential. We explore the impact of nuclear masses calculated with the ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group, focusing on the region around the N = 82 shell closure. We show that such ab initio mass calculations can refine the r-process predictions compared to global, but more phenomenological mass models. With the ab initio masses, the waiting point of the second r-process peak is strengthened, which leads to an overall slower nucleosynthesis flow, lower abundances of nuclei beyond the peak, and a stronger shift of the third r-process peak.
