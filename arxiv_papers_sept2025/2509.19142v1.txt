Abstract:
Bimanual grasping is essential for robots to handle large and complex objects. However, existing methods either focus solely on single-arm grasping or employ separate grasp generation and bimanual evaluation stages, leading to coordination problems including collision risks and unbalanced force distribution. To address these limitations, we propose BiGraspFormer, a unified end-to-end transformer framework that directly generates coordinated bimanual grasps from object point clouds. Our key idea is the Single-Guided Bimanual (SGB) strategy, which first generates diverse single grasp candidates using a transformer decoder, then leverages their learned features through specialized attention mechanisms to jointly predict bimanual poses and quality scores. This conditioning strategy reduces the complexity of the 12-DoF search space while ensuring coordinated bimanual manipulation. Comprehensive simulation experiments and real-world validation demonstrate that BiGraspFormer consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining efficient inference speed (<0.05s), confirming the effectiveness of our framework.
