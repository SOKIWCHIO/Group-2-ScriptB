Abstract:
We have fabricated three-dimensional (3D) networks of ultrathin carbon nanotubes (CNTs) within the ~5-Angstrom diameter pores of zeolite ZSM-5 crystals using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. The 1D electronic characteristics of ultrathin CNTs are characterized by van Hove singularities in the density of states. Boron doping was strategically employed to tune the Fermi energy near a van Hove singularity, which is supported by extensive ab-initio calculations, while the 3D network structure ensures the formation of a phase-coherent bulk superconducting state under a 1D to 3D crossover. We report characteristic signatures of superconductivity using four complementary experimental methods: magnetization, specific heat, resistivity, and point-contact spectroscopy, all consistently support a critical temperature Tc at ambient conditions ranging from 220 to 250 K. In particular, point-contact spectroscopy revealed a multigap nature of superconductivity with a large ~30 meV leading gap, in rough agreement with the prediction of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. The differential conductance response displays a particle-hole symmetry and is tuneable between the tunnelling and Andreev limits via the transparency of the contact, as uniquely expected for a superconductor. Preliminary experiments also reveal a giant pressure effect which increases the Tc above the ambient temperature.
