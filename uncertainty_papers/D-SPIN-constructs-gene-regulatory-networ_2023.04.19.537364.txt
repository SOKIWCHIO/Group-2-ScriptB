Title: D-SPIN constructs gene regulatory network models from multiplexed scRNA-seq data revealing organizing principles of cellular perturbation response

Abstract: Gene regulatory networks within cells modulate the expression of the genome in response to signals and changing environmental conditions. Reconstructions of gene regulatory networks can reveal the information processing and control principles used by cells to maintain homeostasis and execute cell-state transitions. Here, we introduce a computational framework, D-SPIN, that generates quantitative models of gene regulatory networks from single-cell mRNA-seq datasets collected across thousands of distinct perturbation conditions. D-SPIN constructs probabilistic models of regulatory interactions between genes or gene-expression programs to fit the cell state distributions under different perturbations. Using large Perturb-seq and drug-response datasets, we demonstrate that D-SPIN models reveal key regulators of cell fate decisions and the coordination of distant cellular pathways in response to gene knockdown perturbations. D-SPIN also dissects gene-level drug response mechanisms in heterogeneous cell populations, elucidating how combinations of immunomodulatory drugs acting on distinct regulators induce novel cell states through additive recruitment of gene expression programs. D-SPIN provides a computational framework for constructing interpretable models of gene regulatory networks to reveal principles of cellular information processing and physiological control.
